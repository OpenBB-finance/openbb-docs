<HeadTitle title="Basic Response - Usage | OpenBB Platform Docs" />

The output of every command is an object which contains the results of the request, along with additional information. It is a custom class, `OBBject`, and always returns with the fields listed below:

```console
id: ...                 # UUID Tag
results: ...            # Serializable results.
provider: ...           # Provider name.
warnings: ...           # List of warnings.
chart: ...              # Chart object.
extra: ...              # Extra info.
```

```python
from openbb import obb

data = obb.equity.price.historical("SPY", provider="polygon")

data
```

```console
OBBject

id: 06520558-d54a-7e53-8000-7aafc8a42694
results: [{'date': datetime.datetime(2022, 10, 5, 0, 0), 'open': 375.62, 'high': 37...
provider: polygon
warnings: None
chart: None
extra: {'metadata': {'arguments': {'provider_choices': {'provider': 'polygon'}, 'st...
```

Additional class methods are helpers for converting the results to a variety of formats.

- `to_dict()`: converts to a dictionary, accepting all standard "orientation" parameters, i.e., "records"
- `to_df()` / `to_dataframe()`: converts to a Pandas DataFrame.
- `to_numpy()`: converts to a Numpy array.
- `to_polars()`: converts to a Polars table.

:::info
The preferred output type can be set with a user preference.

```python
obb.user.preferences.output_type="dataframe"
```
