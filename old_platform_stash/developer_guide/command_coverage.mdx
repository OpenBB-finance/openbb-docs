## Commands and Provider Coverage

The installed commands and data providers are found under, `obb.coverage`.

```python
obb.coverage
```

```console
/coverage

    providers
    commands
    command_model
    command_schemas
```

`obb.coverage.providers` is a dictionary of the installed provider extensions, each with its own list of available commands.

`obb.coverage.commands` is a dictionary of commands, each with its own list of available providers for the data.

`obb.coverage.command_model` is a dictionary where the keys are the command paths and the values is a nested dictionary of QueryParams and Data models associated with that function.
