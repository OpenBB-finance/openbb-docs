This page will walk through creating a new OpenBB router extension from scratch. By the end, you will have the shell structure for adding commands to the OpenBB Platform's interfaces.

## Preparation

### Create Project Folder

Create a folder for the project. For this example, we will name the folder, `empty_router`.

### Create `pyproject.toml` File

- Open the folder and create a new file called, `pyproject.toml`.

```toml
[tool.poetry]
name = "openbb-empty-router"
version = "0.0.1"
description = "An empty OpenBB Router extension"
authors = ["OpenBB Team <hello@openbb.co>"]
readme = "README.md"
packages = [{ include = "openbb_empty_router" }]

[tool.poetry.dependencies]
python = "^3.8,<3.12"
openbb = "^4.2.0"

[build-system]
requires = ["poetry-core"]
build-backend = "poetry.core.masonry.api"

[tool.poetry.plugins."openbb_core_extension"]
empty = "openbb_empty_router.empty_router:router"
```

### Create `README.md` File

- In the same location, create a new file called, `README.md`.
- Open the file, then add a title and any other high-level information about the extension.

```markdown
# Empty OpenBB Router Extension

An example Router extension for the OpenBB Platform.
```

### Create Sub-Folder For Code

- Create a sub-folder that begins with `openbb` and is followed by the name of the project folder, `openbb_empty_router`.

### Create `__init__.py` File

- In the new sub-folder, create a new file called, `__init__.py`.
- Add a docstring on the first line, followed by an empty line.

```python
"""Empty Router Module."""

```

### Create Router File

- In the same location as the file just saved, create a new file called, `empty_router.py`.

:::info
This is the file mapped at the bottom of the `pyproject.toml` file.

```toml
[tool.poetry.plugins."openbb_core_extension"]
empty = "openbb_empty_router.empty_router:router"
```

:::

- Insert code for our command route.

```python
"""Empty Router"""

from typing import Any, Dict, List, Literal, Optional
from openbb_core.app.model.command_context import CommandContext
from openbb_core.app.model.obbject import OBBject
from openbb_core.app.provider_interface import (
    ExtraParams,
    ProviderChoices,
    StandardParams,
)
from openbb_core.provider.abstract.data import Data
from openbb_core.app.query import Query
from openbb_core.app.router import Router
from openbb_core.app.model.obbject import OBBject

router = Router(prefix="", description="An Empty OpenBB Router Extension.")

@router.command(methods=["GET"])
async def hello() -> OBBject[str]: # The output of every router command must be an instance of `OBBject`.
    """OpenBB Hello World."""
    return OBBject(results="Hello from the Empty Router extension!")

# This is a clone of `obb.equity.price.historical`.
# The model can be replaced with a a different model from the Provider Interface.
@router.command(
    model="EquityHistorical",
)
async def empty_function(
    cc: CommandContext,
    provider_choices: ProviderChoices,
    standard_params: StandardParams,
    extra_params: ExtraParams,
) -> OBBject[Data]:
    """An empty function using the Provider Interface."""
    return await OBBject.from_query(Query(**locals()))
```

## Build Lock File

- The Python environment should have `toml` and `poetry` installed as packages from PyPI.

```console
pip install toml poetry
```

- Navigate into the main folder, and with the environment active, enter:

```console
poetry lock
```

## Install Extension In Editable Mode

```console
pip install -e .
```

The installation can be verified, and it should display a path similar to the one below.
Everything else is installed under the `site-packages` of the environment.

```console
pip list | grep openbb
```

```console
openbb                  4.1.7
openbb-benzinga         1.1.5
openbb-commodity        1.0.4
openbb-core             1.1.6
openbb-crypto           1.1.5
openbb-currency         1.1.5
openbb-derivatives      1.1.5
openbb-economy          1.1.5
openbb-empty-router     0.0.1        /Users/username/path_to_created_folder/empty_router
...
```

## Build Static Assets

```console
python -c "import openbb; openbb.build()"
```

The installation can be verified by inspecting `obb.reference`. Start a Python session and import the OpenBB Platform.

```python
from openbb import obb

obb.reference["info"]["extensions"]["openbb_core_extension"]
```

The list should include the newly created and installed extension, `empty@0.0.1`.

## Smoke Test

Run the added commands.

```python
obb.empty.hello()
```

```console
OBBject

id: 0663956f-a01d-751b-8000-b44c72e60664
results: Hello from the Empty Router extension!
provider: None
warnings: None
chart: None
extra: {'metadata': {'arguments': {'provider_choices': {}, 'standard_params': {}, '...
```

## Conclusion

This process created, built, and installed a new OpenBB router extension from scratch.

The next step is to map Provider Interface models, and/or create custom GET/POST request functions to import directly for use in the router.
