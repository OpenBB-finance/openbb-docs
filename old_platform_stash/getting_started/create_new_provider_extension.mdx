This page will walk through creating a new OpenBB Provider Extension from scratch. By the end, you will have the shell structure for holding models that connect to the Router through the Provider Interface.


## Preparation

### Create Project Folder

Create a folder for the project. For this example, we will name the folder, `empty_provider`.

### Create `__init__.py` File

- Inside the new folder, create a new file called, `__init__.py`.
- Open the file and add a docstring in the first line, and leave an empty line below it.

```python
"""Empty OpenBB Provider."""
```

### Create `README.md` File

- In the same location, create a new file called, `README.md`.
- Open the file, then add a title and any other high-level information about the extension.

```markdown
# Empty OpenBB Provider Extension

An example Provider extension for the OpenBB Platform.
```

### Create `pyproject.toml` File

- In the same location, create a new file called, `pyproject.toml`.

```toml
[tool.poetry]
name = "openbb-empty-provider"
version = "0.0.1"
description = "Empty provider extension for OpenBB"
authors = ["OpenBB Team <hello@openbb.co>"]
readme = "README.md"
packages = [{ include = "openbb_empty_provider" }]

[tool.poetry.dependencies]
python = ">=3.8,<3.12"
openbb = "^4.1.7"

[build-system]
requires = ["poetry-core"]
build-backend = "poetry.core.masonry.api"

[tool.poetry.plugins."openbb_provider_extension"]
empty = "openbb_empty_provider:empty_provider"
```

### Create Sub-Folder For Code

- Create a sub-folder that begins with `openbb` and is followed by the name of the project folder, `openbb_empty_provider`.

### Create `__init__.py` File

- In the new sub-folder, create a new file called, `__init__.py`. This is where all models are mapped to the Provider interface.

```python
"""Empty Provider Module."""

from openbb_core.provider.abstract.provider import Provider

empty_provider = Provider(
    name="empty", # This should be the same as the assigned name at the bottom of the pyproject.toml file
    website="http://empty.io",
    description="""The empty provider is a supplier of promises.""",
    #credentials=["api_key"], # uncomment to require credentials
    fetcher_dict={
    #    "SomeModel" : EmptySomeModelFetcher  # Map Fetchers to the Router here.
    },
)
```

### Create `models` Sub-Folder

- In the same location as the file just saved, create a new folder called, `models`.

### Create `__init__.py` File

- In the new `models` folder, make a new file called, `__init__.py`.
- Open the file and add a doctstring to the top line, followed by an empty line.

```python
"""Empty Provider Models."""

```

## Build Lock File

- The Python environment should have `toml` and `poetry` installed as packages from PyPI.

```console
pip install toml poetry
```

- Navigate into the main folder, and with the environment active, enter:

```console
poetry lock
```

## Install Extension In Editable Mode

```console
pip install -e .
```

The installation can be verified, and it should display a path similar to the one below.
Everything else is installed under the `site-packages` of the environment.

```console
pip list | grep openbb
```

```console
openbb                  4.1.7
openbb-benzinga         1.1.5
openbb-commodity        1.0.4
openbb-core             1.1.6
openbb-crypto           1.1.5
openbb-currency         1.1.5
openbb-derivatives      1.1.5
openbb-economy          1.1.5
openbb-empty-provider   0.0.1        /Users/username/path_to_created_folder/empty_provider
...
```

## Build Static Assets

```console
python -c "import openbb; openbb.build()"
```

The installation can be verified by inspecting `obb.reference`. Start a Python session and import the OpenBB Platform.

```python
from openbb import obb

obb.reference["info"]["extensions"]["openbb_provider_extension"]
```

The list should include the newly created and installed extension, `empty@0.0.1`.

## Conclusion

This process created, built, and installed a new OpenBB Platform Provider extension from scratch.

The next step is to create the models for connecting with the Provider Interface and Router.
