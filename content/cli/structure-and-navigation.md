## Structure

The OpenBB Platform CLI is a Command Line Interface (CLI) application. Functions (commands) are called through the keyboard with results returned as charts, tables, or text.  Charts and tables (if enabled) are displayed in a new window, and are fully interactive, while text prints directly to the Terminal screen.

A menu is a collection of commands (and sub-menus). A menu can be distinguished from a command because the former has a `>` on the left. The color of a command and a menu also differ.

## Navigation

Navigating through the CLI menus is similar to traversing folders from any operating system's command line prompt. The `/home` screen is the main directory where everything begins, and the menus are paths branched from the main. Instead of `C:\Users\OpenBB\Documents`, you'll have something like `/equity/price`. Instead of `cd ..`, you can do `..` to return the menu right above. To go back to the root menu you can do `/`.

### Absolute Paths

Absolute paths are also valid to-and-from any point. From the `/equity/price` menu, you can go directly to `crypto` menu with: `/crypto`. Note the forward slash at the start to denote the "absolute" path.

### Home

Return to the Home screen from anywhere by entering any of the following:

- `/`
- `home`
