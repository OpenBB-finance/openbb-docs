OpenBB script routines can be captured with the macro recorder, controlled with global commands. Enter, `record`, to start saving commands, and then, `stop`, terminates the recording. This means that any command you run will be captured in the script; and on `stop`, it will be saved to the `~/OpenBBUserData/routines/` folder.

For example:

```console
record -n sample

/equity/price/historical --symbol SPY --provider cboe --interval 1m/home/derivatives/options/chains --symbol SPY --provider cboe/home/stop/r
```

The final command after `stop`, `r`, resets the CLI so that the routine is presented as a choice in the `exe` command.

It can now be played back by entering:

```console
/exe --file sample.openbb
```

:::tip
The routine can be edited to replace parameter values with input variables - e.g, `$ARGV[0]`, `$ARGV[1]`, etc.
