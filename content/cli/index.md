## Overview

The OpenBB Platform CLI is a command line interface wrapping the OpenBB Platform. It offers a convenient way to interact with the Platform and its extensions, as well as automate data collection via OpenBB Routine Scripts.

The CLI is the next iteration of the [OpenBB Terminal](/platform), and leverages the extendability of the OpenBB Platform architecture in an easy-to-consume and script format.
