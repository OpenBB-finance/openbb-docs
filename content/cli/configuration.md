In addition to the OpenBB Platform's `user_settings.json` file, described [here](/platform/settings_and_environment_variables), there are settings and environment variables affecting the CLI only.

:::important
API credentials are defined in the `user_settings.json` file.

Find all data providers [here](/platform/user_guides/extensions), and manage all your credentials directly on the [OpenBB Hub](https://my.openbb.co/app/platform/credentials).

Define default data sources by following the pattern outlined [here](data-sources)

## Settings Menu

- Feature Flags
  - On/Off status is reflected by red/green text.
  - Status is toggled by entering the item as a command.
- Preferences
  - Choices and options will be presented as a typical function.
