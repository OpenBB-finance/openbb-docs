Our product offers two different plans:
    - **OpenBB Terminal** - Free version for individuals
    - **OpenBB Terminal Pro** - Enterprise for teams and professionals

The products, features and services that come with an enterprise are mentioned below.

## Excel Add-In

The enterprise plan, enables users to have access to the financial data directly from Excel, or export any dataset into an Excel format.

For more information, check [OpenBB Add-in for Excel](http://docs.openbb.co/excel).

</div>

## Export Data

Users are able to export any data from OpenBB, either in CSV, JSON, XLSX or other format. This is achieved by having redistribution rights on the data.

## Database Integrations

There are two ways to connect to your databases or data warehouses. The first is through [custom backends](https://github.com/OpenBB-finance/backend-for-terminal-pro/tree/main), which allow users to connect to platforms like Snowflake, Databricks, Elastic, Clickhouse, and others. However, the user experience may not be optimal.

To address this, we also provide a data connector that enables users to securely connect to their databases or data warehouses in seconds, rather than hours. Supported connections currently include Snowflake, SQLite, and MySQL, with more options coming soon.

## Dashboard Sharing

Keep your dashboards private and securely accessible only to your organization. Upon signing up, we’ll create an organization account for you and your team. You can grant specific team members access to dashboards.

</div>

## Team Management

Gain access to a user management portal where you can manage access to your firm’s workspace. You can invite or remove members, export the entire user list, and view their last login times.

## AI Copilot resources

You will have generous access to both file uploads and Copilot, with 100 requests per hour. If you need additional requests, you can bring your own OpenAI key or contact us.
