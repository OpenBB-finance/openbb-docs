API endpoints are the fastest way to integrate your custom data into OpenBB Terminal Pro. This method allows you to import data via a URL or endpoint that is directly rendered into a table format providing a quick and easy way to visualize your data.

Simply enter your API endpoint along with any required connection details. Once configured, you need to select the metadata and then a corresponding widget will be created. It will then dynamically load and display your data within the Terminal Pro interface.

For something more custom, you should look into creating [your own backend](/pro/data-connectors/integrate-your-own-backend), or reach out for support.

## Common Issues and Solutions

**Why can't I see my data in the table?**
> Ensure that the endpoint or url you are using returns data in JSON format

**I'm getting an error that it can't fetch the url**
> Your endpoint might require additional headers to be passed, you can add them using the '+ Add Headers' button.

**My data isn't showing up correctly in the table.**
> If your API endpoint doesn't return a a simple JSON but a nested architecture, you will be prompted with a "Data Key" parameter which you can use to grab the data of interest.
> You may also need to use our [Custom Backend](/pro/integrate-your-own-backend) if you want to do anything else like processing the data.

If your issue is not listed above, please contact support at [support@openbb.finance](mailto:support@openbb.finance) with details of your problem.
