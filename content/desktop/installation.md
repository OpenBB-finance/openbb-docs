## Installation

### macOS

Open the DMG file and then drag-and-drop the app into the Applications folder.

### Windows

## First Run

When first run, you will be asked to select an installation location.

The user data directory is where the OpenBB Python packages should store data, such as data/HTTP cache. It is recommeneded to use separate locations for each.
