<HeadTitle title="Importing - ODP Python | OpenBB Docs" />

The pages in this section explain the basic query syntax for OpenBB Python functions, what to expect on output, well as instructions for building the static assets behind the `obb` Python Package.

## Endpoint & Model Definitions

All endpoints generated by extensions in the official OpenBB GitHub [repo](https://github.com/OpenBB-finance/OpenBB/) are detailed under the [Reference](/python/reference) section of the documentation. Standard models are defined under, [Models](/python/data_models).

:::note
Because of the modular framework, your specific installation may not contain all points of reference.
:::

## Static Assets

The ODP Python Package is compiled into static files, post-installation, based on the installed extensions.

This occurs automatically on first import and will not require a restart of the interpreter.

For general use, importing the package is all you need to do.

When deploying for use in a remote container or temporary environment,
always run `openbb-build` immediately after installation.

:::info Static Assets are exclusive to the Python Interface.
Files imported, by `from openbb import obb`, are not used by the API or MCP servers.
:::

Rebuild them post-installation, or after removals and updates.
You may need to invoke the `openbb-build` command manually on occassion.

### Command Line

From the command line, with the environment active, run:

```sh
openbb-build
```

The script attempts to import the OpenBB package, and watches for assets being built.

```sh
Attempting to import the OpenBB package...

Building...
```

If nothing to add or remove were detected, `openbb-build` will force the static files to be refreshed.

```sh

Did not build on import, triggering rebuild...
```

### Verbose

Errors will be printed if the build process fails, and you can enable debug mode to see STDOUT while the build is occuring.
Set the [environment variable](/python/settings/environment_variables) to enable.

```env
OPENBB_DEBUG_MODE='true'
```

## Importing

Initializing ODP in another application should be controlled by a single, synchronous, event - preferably on startup.

```python
from openbb import obb
```

:::warning
Race conditions can occur where multi-threaded tasks share `site-packages` while static assets are built.

Static assets will need to be updated when extensions are installed, removed, or upgraded in an environment.
:::


### Controlled Import

Importing the `obb` application can take several hundred megabytes of memory, and you may need to control when it is first initialized.
