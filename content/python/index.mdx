The ODP Python Package serves as scaffolding for a unified API that is standardized, consumable, and deployable across multiple mediums simultaneously - REST API, pure Python, Jupyter Notebook, MCP, Docker, OpenBB Workspace, Excel, etc. - from a single source of truth.

With cross-compatibility out-of-the-box, its ready-to-use data connectors, and a wealth of extensions, it lets you concentrate on creating outstanding research reports and applications quickly and easily.

## Installation

:::info Packages are distributed via PyPI.
They can be installed in any Python environment with a version between 3.10 and 3.13.
```sh
pip install openbb
```
:::

Go to the [installation](/python/installation) page for detailed instructions, and see the [extensions](/python/extensions) page for information on individual components.

:::tip Looking for a graphical method, or having trouble with virtual environments?
Go to the [Open Data Platform](/desktop#installation) to get started.

## User, Developer, or Contributor?

The line between user and developer can be blurry, and is often the same individual.

For the purpose of this documentation, a User represents a person, organization, robot,
or other type of end-user consuming the interface(s) as-supplied.

A contributor is someone submitting a pull request to the OpenBB GitHub repository.

Most other use-cases fall somewhere on the development spectrum.

### Example Users

- Consuming data or services from published packages via a supported interface.
  - `pip install openbb`
- General use of `from openbb import obb`, `openbb-api`, `openbb-mcp`, etc.
  - This could be for local development or remote deployment.

### Example Developer

- Creating OpenBB extensions or Workspace applications.
- Importing individual components or utility functions. 
- Preparing an OpenBB environment, container, or application for non-personal use.

## Developer Docs

The [developer](/python/developer) pages provide an orientation to the codebase, as well as technical details and snippets for working with it.
