<HeadTitle title="Python Packages & Extensions | OpenBB Docs" />

An OpenBB environment is the combination of packages installed. The core is the underlying infrastructure, while extensions represent API routes, data sources, and the response object.

When you run, `pip install openbb`, you the extensions maintained in the official OpenBB GitHub [repository](https://www.github.com/OpenBB-finance/OpenBB). You can create your own custom Python apps by extending the `openbb-core` library, or by selectively installing individual components.

Anyone can build and publish [installable extensions](/python/developer/extension_types) for the OpenBB ecosystem.

## Core

All OpenBB packages are extensions of `openbb-core`.

<ul className="grid grid-cols-1 gap-2 -ml-6">
  <NewReferenceCard
    title="OpenBB Core"
    description="A light-weight package responsible for base operations, serialized ETL pipelines, and package building. It is developed with Pydantic and FastAPI."
    url="extensions/openbb-core"
  />
</ul>

## Infrastructure

<ul className="grid grid-cols-1 gap-2 -ml-6">
  <NewReferenceCard
    title="OpenBB Providers"
    description="A providers is an individual source of data implementing the standardized pipeline. They are self-contained, and feed shared router endpoints."
    url="/python/extensions/providers/"
  />
  <NewReferenceCard
    title="OpenBB Routers"
    description="Routers direct the IO of the application. They are instances of `fastapi.APIRouter`, are self-contained, and do not depend on another."
    url="reference/"
  />
  <NewReferenceCard
    title="OpenBB Charting"
    description="Extend routers with REST API compatible views, and with an optional Python method for dedicated window creation."
    url="extensions/infrastructure/openbb-charting"
  />
</ul>

## Interface

These tools extend and enhance last mile delivery of OPD packages to interface with additional mediums, like the OpenBB Workspace.

<ul className="grid grid-cols-1 gap-2 -ml-6">
  <NewReferenceCard
    title="OpenBB Platform API"
    description="Generate OpenBB Workspace Widgets and Applications. Create dashboarding experiences with zero frontend code, from any FastAPI."
    url="extensions/interface/openbb-api"
  />
  <NewReferenceCard
    title="OpenBB MCP Server"
    description="Convert OpenBB environments, and FastAPI instances, into ready-to-use MCP servers. Highly configurable, and easily secured. Connect AI to your data, on your terms."
    url="extensions/interface/openbb-mcp"
  />
  <NewReferenceCard
    title="OpenBB CLI"
    description="Explore OpenBB environments from a scriptable, Command Line Interface (CLI)."
    url="/cli"
  />
</ul>

## Data Processing

Unlike data-fetching endpoints, these routers do not have a `provider` component.
OpenBB publishes several extensions for data analysis and feature engineering pipelines.

<ul className="grid grid-cols-1 gap-2 -ml-6">

    description="REST API compatible econometrics models, such as OLS."
    url="/python/extensions/data-processing/econometrics"
  />
  <NewReferenceCard
    title="OpenBB Quantitative"
    description="REST API compatible quantitative analysis tools."
    url="/python/extensions/data-processing/quantitative"
  />
  <NewReferenceCard
    title="OpenBB Technical"
    description="REST API compatible time series analysis tools."
    url="/python/extensions/data-processing/technical"
  />
</ul>
