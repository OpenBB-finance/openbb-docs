import HeadTitle from '@site/src/components/General/HeadTitle.tsx';

Provider extensions expand the breadth and coverage of the data available from the application endpoints.
Each source (provider) is its own independent extension, even if there is only one endpoint accessible.
This allows every data source to be inserted or removed, at any time, without disturbing the operation of the Core components.

Fetchers can be executed individually, independent of any router and interface.
They do not require static assets or application import to use.

## Provider Coverage

The total installed coverage can be determined through the Python interface.

```python
from openbb import obb
obb.coverage.providers
```

:::tip Missing endpoints or providers?
You might find that your build is "incomplete" when compared to the [reference](/python/reference) documentation.
Is it installed and/or configured with credentials? Try installing individually and then run `openbb-build`.
:::

## Available Provider Extensions

A variety of data sources are available out-of-the-box. Others need to be installed independently.
Anyone can build and publish data provider extensions for ODP.
See the documentation [here](/python/developer/extension_types/provider) to get started building.

:::important
OpenBB does not host or serve any data, and it provides connectors without warranty or support.
Bugs should be reported on [GitHub](https://github.com/OpenBB-finance/OpenBB/issues/new/choose)
:::

Many data providers require an API key for access.
Use the "API Key Name" column in the tables below to configure the user settings.

### Public Data

Along with the routers, these packages will be installed when `pip install openbb` is run.
Sources of the data are public agencies providing open APIs.
Some require registration, but all are free.

:::info `pip install "openbb[all]"`
The behaviour of package extras may change in the future, installing modules individually is encouraged.
