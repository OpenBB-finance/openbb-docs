Most systems capable of running Python `3.10-3.13` will be compatible. 

### System Requirements

A modern processor (five years or less), running an up-to-date operating system, with at least 8GB of RAM, is recommended. Maintaining the system with current patches ensures maximum compatibility. At a minimum, Windows and macOS should be:

- Windows 11
- Mac OS Big Sur

Linux users should run the command line update for the package manager, prior to installation.

### Install via ODP Desktop

For a graphical installer, see the [ODP](/odp/installation) desktop application.

### Setup Environment

:::tip
If you are having trouble with virtual environments or package installation, use the ODP [Desktop Application](/odp/installation) instead.
:::

The method for creating the environment will be a matter of user preference, from the command line - [Conda](https://docs.conda.io/projects/miniconda/en/latest/miniconda-install.html), [venv](https://docs.python.org/3/library/venv.html), etc. - or in a code editor and IDE - [VS Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/languages/python), [PyCharm](https://www.jetbrains.com/pycharm/), [Jupyter](https://jupyter.org/).

If you're interested in building a [Docker](/platform/installation#docker) container, skip ahead to the specific section [below](/platform/installation#docker).

For those new to Python, [this article](https://www.infoworld.com/article/3306656/python-virtualenv-and-venv-dos-and-donts.html) shares some tips on getting started and why environments are important.

See [this guide](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/python/environments) for creating a Python environment in VS Code.

Before installation, update the package manager so that `pip` is current, then create the environment with the desired version of Python.

:::warning
Installing packages directly to the system Python or `base` environment is not recommended. Create a new environment first.
:::

## Install

With the environment created, and activated, begin the installation process.

### PyPI

```console
pip install openbb
```



### Docker

<details>
<summary mdxType="summary">We provide a `platformAPI.Dockerfile` on [GitHub](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/OpenBB-finance/OpenBB/refs/heads/develop/build/docker/platformAPI.Dockerfile)</summary>

Run the following command from the repo root to build the image:

```bash
docker build -f build/docker/platformAPI.Dockerfile -t openbb-platform:latest .
```

To run it:

```bash
docker run -it --rm -p 6900:6900 -v ~/.openbb_platform:/root/.openbb_platform openbb-platform:latest
```

This will mount the local `~/.openbb_platform` directory into the Docker container to use and exposes the API on port `6900`.

</details>

### Source

To install from source, create a Python virtual environment and update `pip` and `setuptools`, within the newly created environment, **before** installing any packages.

<details>
To build the OpenBB Platform from the source code, first install `git`:

```console
pip install git
```

Next, clone the repository from GitHub:

```console
git clone git@github.com:OpenBB-finance/OpenBB.git
```

When it is done, checkout the branch where the code is living:

```console
git checkout develop
```

Then, `cd` into the directory:

```console
cd openbb_platform
```

Install required packages

```console
pip install poetry
```

Finally, run the developer installation script:

```console
python dev_install.py
```

:::note
To install all extensions and providers, run: `python dev_install.py -e`
:::

</details>

## Post-Installation

When using the Python Interface, the static assets will need to be generated. This happens on first import but, when installing inside a container or CI, invoke the build command immediately after installation.

```console
openbb-build
```

### Getting Started

See the [quickstart](/python/quickstart) guide for getting started with the ODP Python Package.
