By default, authorization is not required to initialize and use the core services. Most data providers, however, require an API key to access their data. Keys are stored locally, in the `~/.openbb_platform/user_settings.json` file, under the `credentials` object.

### Local Configuration

Credentials and user preferences are stored locally, `~/.openbb_platform/`, as a JSON file, `user_settings.json`. It is read upon initializing the Python client, or when the Fast API is authorized. If the file does not exist, it will be created on the first run. The schema below can be copy/pasted as a template:

```json
{
  "credentials": {
    "fmp_api_key": "REPLACE",
    "polygon_api_key": "REPLACE",
    "benzinga_api_key": "REPLACE",
    "fred_api_key": "REPLACE",
    "nasdaq_api_key": "REPLACE",
    "intrinio_api_key": "REPLACE",
    "alpha_vantage_api_key": "REPLACE",
    "biztoc_api_key": "REPLACE",
    "tradier_api_key": "REPLACE",
    "tradier_account_type": "sandbox OR live",
    "tradingeconomics_api_key": "REPLACE",
    "tiingo_token": "REPLACE"
  }
}
```

To set keys from the Python client for the current session only, access the Credentials class:

```python
obb.user.credentials.intrinio_api_key = "my_api_key"
```

:::info
See [Environment Variables](/python/settings/environment_variables) & [System Settings](/python/settings/system_settings) for more information on configuring the installation via `user_settings.json`.

See [Extensions](/python/extensions) for a current list of data provider extensions.
