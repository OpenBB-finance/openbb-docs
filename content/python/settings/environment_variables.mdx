Environment variables are defined in a `.env` file. If this file does not exist, create it inside the same folder `user_settings.json` is located.

- `OPENBB_DEBUG_MODE`: enables verbosity while running the program
- `OPENBB_DEV_MODE`: applicable to the API; exposes, /system and /user, paths.
- `OPENBB_AUTO_BUILD`: enables automatic SDK package build on import
- `OPENBB_API_AUTH_EXTENSION`: specifies which API authentication extension to use
- `OPENBB_API_AUTH`: enables API authentication for command endpoints
- `OPENBB_API_USERNAME`: sets API username
- `OPENBB_API_PASSWORD`: sets API password

Variables can be defined for current session only.

```python
import os
os.environ["OPENBB_DEBUG_MODE"] = "True"
from openbb import obb
```

## API Keys

In addition to `user_settings.json`, API keys can be defined as environment variables (openbb-core V1.4.8).

For example, to define `fmp_api_key` as an environment variable, add the following to the `~/.openbb_platform/.env` file.
If it doesn't exist, create it.

```env
FMP_API_KEY = "replaceWITHyourK3Y"
```

Along with the installed providers' credentials, if an entry in the `.env` file ends with `_API_KEY`, it will be accessible as, `obb.user.credentials.some_key`
