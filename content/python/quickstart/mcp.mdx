Install the package to get started using the ODP Python Package as a MCP server.

```sh
pip install openbb-mcp-server
```

## Start Server

The server is started using the command line executable:

```sh
openbb-mcp
```

This starts the server on http://127.0.0.1:8001 over the `streamable-http` transport and exposes all GET endpoints as MCP tools.

## Add to Workspace

Follow the steps [here](/workspace/analysts/ai-features/mcp-tools) to connect the server with Workspace.
