# Backends

The **Backends** screen lets you run arbitrary application servers (e.g. the `openbb-api`, a FastAPI micro-service, a websocket relay, or a custom Python script) under the control of the OpenBB GUI. Each backend is started inside a selected OpenBB *Environment* and can be stopped, edited, or deleted at any time.

## Why run backends?

* Expose OpenBB REST endpoints locally for Workspace widgets, Excel, or third-party tools.
* Host data pipelines that stream quotes/events to TradingView or dashboards.
* Prototype agent workflows that rely on the [OpenBB MCP](/workspace/ai-agents.md).
* Keep everything running **locally** – ideal for air-gapped research labs.

## Feature overview

Below is a summary of everything you can accomplish on the backends screen:

* **Create a backend definition** – provide a name, choose the Conda environment in which the process should run, and supply the executable command. Optional fields let you override host/port, pick a working directory, and attach a `.env` file.
* **Start and stop services** – one click launches the process, another stops it. Status chips show *starting*, *running*, *stopping*, or *error* so you always know what is happening.
* **Enable auto-start** – flag a service to launch automatically when you open the GUI. Combine with the tray-menu option *Start at login* to have backends running after system boot.
* **View logs in real time** – each service can open its own log window.
* **Generate self-signed certificates** - create a SSL certificate for running a backend over HTTPS.

## Creating a Backend Service

1. Click **New Backend**.
2. Fill the **Backend Name** (required).
3. Select the **Environment** that contains the required packages.
4. **Executable** – anything you would type in a shell, e.g. `openbb-api`, `uvicorn myapp:app --reload`, `python feed.py --ws`.
5. *(Optional)* **Working Directory** – folder from which the command is executed.
6. *(Optional)* **Environment File** – path to a `.env` file whose variables are exported before launch.
7. Enable **Start Automatically** if desired.
8. Press **Create**.

The new backend appears in the list. Use the **Start** button to launch it.

## Self-Signed Certificate

1. Click **Generate Certificate**
2. Enter the required fields:
  - Common Name (e.g., localhost)
  - Organization Name (e.g., My Organization)
  - Output Directory (path to where the files should be created)
3. Enter any optional fields:
  - Alternative Names (e.g., 127.0.0.1,0.0.0.0)
  - Password (set for PKCS#12 bundle)
  - Days Valid (default 1 year)
4. Check the box to also add the certificate to the system's trust store.
  - An operating system dialog will open to confirm adding the certificate.

If using Uvicorn (or `openbb-api`) to start the backend, set environment variables pointing to the file locations.

```env
UVICORN_SSL_CERTFILE = "/Users/someuser/pathto/certs/certificate.pem"
UVICORN_SSL_KEYFILE = "/Users/someuser/pathto/certs/private.key"
```

:::info
When opening the server docs - https://localhost:8000/docs - the certificate must be manually approved in each browser.

Follow the warning dialogs that display on navigation.

## Troubleshooting & FAQ

| Question | Answer |
| --- | --- |
| "Backend stuck at *starting*" | After 20 s a failsafe sets the status to *running*. Check logs to verify the server actually bound a port. |
| Startup traceback | The GUI captures the full traceback and stops the service; open logs for details, fix code, then **Start** again. |
| Port already in use | Edit the backend and change **Port** or stop the conflicting process. |
| How do I expose the API to my LAN? | Edit **Host** to `0.0.0.0` and ensure your firewall allows the chosen port. |
| Can I run non-Python services? | Yes – any executable/script is allowed as long as it runs inside the selected Conda environment. |
