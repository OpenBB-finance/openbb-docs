# Environments

The Environments screen lets you create and manage **isolated Conda environments** that run the OpenBB Platform (and anything else you install) without polluting your system-wide Python. Each environment lives inside the OpenBB installation folder, contains its own Python interpreter, packages, and **OpenBB extensions**, and can be deleted at any time.

## Why use environments?

* Keep research projects, prototypes, tutorials, or client deliverables fully isolated.
* Test the upcoming **development** version of OpenBB without touching your daily environment.
* Run multiple Python versions (3.8 → 3.12) side-by-side.
* Ship a ready-to-run `requirements.txt`, `pyproject.toml`, or Conda YAML to a colleague – they can import it in one click.
* Use it as a lightweight alternative to BQuant/Anaconda for quant notebooks.

## Feature overview

Here is a high-level glance at what you can do with the environments screen:

* **Create a new environment** – provide a name, pick a Python version, and optionally pre-install OpenBB extensions or any PyPI package.
* **Import from a file** – point to a `requirements.txt`, `pyproject.toml`, or Conda YAML and the GUI will reproduce it locally.
* **Manage packages** – install, update, or uninstall packages at any time through the *Extensions* side-panel; the action happens inside the selected environment only.
* **Update everything at once** – use the *update* button to upgrade **all** installed packages to their latest compatible versions.
* **Work in context** – open a system terminal, start an interactive Python or IPython shell, or launch JupyterLab directly in the environment.
* **Choose working directory** – define the folder where terminals and notebooks start so your code and data are neatly organised.
* **Delete safely** – when an environment is no longer needed it can be removed together with every package it contained.

## Creating a new environment

1. Click **New Environment**.
2. **Name** – lower-case letters, numbers & dashes only (`my-research`).
3. **Python version** – 3.8 → 3.12 (the GUI retrieves pre-built Conda distributions).
4. **Extensions (optional)** – search & select any OpenBB extension or enter a PyPI package name.
   * Skip this step to create a *bare* environment.
5. Press **Create Environment**. A progress overlay appears; you can **Cancel Installation** at any point.

---

## Importing from an existing spec

Choose **Import Environment** and select **one** of the following files:

* `requirements.txt`
* `pyproject.toml`
* Conda `environment.yml` / `*.yaml`

Then provide an environment name and click **Create Environment**. The GUI uploads the file path to the backend – no temporary copies are created.

---

## Working directory

The *Current Working Directory* panel defines where spawned terminals, Python/IPython shells and Jupyter notebooks will start.

* Type a path manually or click the folder icon.
* A ✓ / ⚠️ indicator shows whether the directory exists (checked via the backend).
* Hit **Enter** or blur the input to save. The preference is persisted across sessions.

---

### Extensions panel

* Search packages by name or version.
* **Install** multiple packages at once (uses `pip`).
* **Update** or **Delete** individual packages.
* The GUI caches the extension list per environment in `localStorage` to avoid repetitive backend calls.

## Troubleshooting & FAQ

| Question | Answer |
| --- | --- |
| "Directory does not exist" | Ensure the path is reachable by the OS user account. Network drives may require additional permissions. |
| "FutureWarning" during install | These are non-fatal; the GUI continues automatically. |
| "Prefix record insertion error" | A known Conda bug – the environment is usually created successfully. The GUI handles this automatically. |
| How do I keep a Jupyter server running while I browse other pages? | The GUI tracks active servers and will leave them running until you explicitly stop them. |
| Can I edit `pyproject.toml` after import? | Yes – open the Extensions tab and manage packages as usual. |
