<HeadTitle title="REST API - Quick Start | OpenBB Docs" />

The configurable REST API is generated by FastAPI. To start it, activate the Python environment, then run the following command:

```console
uvicorn openbb_core.api.rest_api:app
```

:::info
This starts a server on `http://127.0.0.1:8000`

See [System Settings](/odp/python/settings/system_settings) for API configuration and runtime settings.
:::

## Running in a Container

Use `0.0.0.0` as the host for containerized, or network, deployments.

```console
uvicorn openbb_core.api.rest_api:app --host 0.0.0.0 --port 8000
```

To learn more about how you can run the API in different scenarios refer to [uvicorn's documentation](https://www.uvicorn.org/#command-line-options)

## API Documentation

The default settings provide two flavors of interactive API documentation.

- Swagger: `http://127.0.0.1:8000/docs`
- Redoc: `http://127.0.0.1:8000/redoc`

Both provide detailed descriptions and functions can be executed directly from the page.

Please note that some descriptions and parameter dropdown choices may appear incomplete or linked to the wrong provider. These visual inconsistencies may differ between Redoc and Swagger but do not impact the normal operation or expected behaviour of the API.

## API Authorization

By default, no authorization is required. Data provider credentials must be configured in [`user_settings.json`](/odp/python/settings/user_settings/api_keys)

:::warning
Production environments should utilize access controls and HTTPS encryption.
:::

Basic authorization can be enabled with [environment variables](/odp/python/settings/environment_variables).

```.env
OPENBB_API_AUTH="True"
OPENBB_API_USERNAME="my_email"
OPENBB_API_PASSWORD="my_password"
```

The application will expect a header that contains authorization in the form of `Basic <username:password>`, where "username:password" is a Base64-encoded string.

Pass in the "Authorization" headers of every request to the API.

Here is Python example calling the API where Basic Authorization has been enabled.

```python
import base64
import requests

msg = "some_user:some_pass"
msg_bytes = msg.encode('ascii')
base64_bytes = base64.b64encode(msg_bytes)
base64_msg = base64_bytes.decode('ascii')

symbol="SPY"
url = f"http://127.0.0.1:8000/api/v1/equity/price/quote?provider=fmp&symbol={symbol}"
headers = {"accept": "application/json", "Authorization": f"Basic {base64_msg}"}

response = requests.get(url=url, headers=headers)

response.json()
```

## CORS Configuration

CORS defines the rules for which external domains are allowed to access your API.

:::danger
The default settings are permissive (["*"]), and are suitable for development.

When deploying to the public internet, specify exact domains, methods, and headers to enforce security.

Always run deployed servers over HTTPS.
:::

## HTTPS

Running localhost over HTTPS can appear to be trickier than it needs to be.
The simplest method is to generate a self-signed certificate using the [OPD Desktop](/odp/desktop/backends#self-signed-certificate) feature.

Then use Uvicorn runtime arguments, or environment variables, pointing to the file locations.

```
UVICORN_SSL_CERTFILE = "/pathto/public_folder/certificate.pem"
UVICORN_SSL_KEYFILE = "/pathto/private_folder/private.key"
```

## OpenBB API

`openbb-api` is a command line executable that imports the `app` instance and extends it by building and serving configuration files for OpenBB Workspace, converting API endpoints into interactive widgets.

Go to the extension's [documentation](/odp/python/extensions/interface/openbb-api) for launch arguments and usage examples.
