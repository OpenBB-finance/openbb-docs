The Standardization Framework is a set of tools and guidelines that enable the user to query and obtain data in a consistent way across multiple providers.

Provider models can inherit from an already defined [standard](/odp/python/data_models) model.
The standard models are also the metamodel names defined in the Router's [function definition](/odp/python/developer/extension_types/router),
and the Provider's [`fetcher_dict`](/odp/python/developer/extension_types/provider)

Standardizing provider query parameters and response data enhances the user experience by overcoming things like:

- Transparently defined schemas for the data and query parameters.
- Outputs from multiple sources are comparable with each other and easily interchanged.
- Consistent query parameters across all data sources for a function, or type of function.
  - Use `symbol` instead of `ticker`.
- Output data that has conformed types, is validated, and will be JSON serializable.
  - `NaN`, `NaT`, `"None"`, empty strings, should be `NoneType` (null).
  - Percent values should be represented as decimal points.
- Parameter and fields are always `lower_snake_case`.

The standard models [here](/odp/python/data_models) are the contents of the repository code - `/OpenBB/openbb_platform/core/openbb_core/provider/standard_models/` [directory](https://github.com/OpenBB-finance/OpenBB/tree/main/openbb_platform/core/openbb_core/provider/standard_models).

Every standard model consists of two classes, with each being a Pydantic model.

- [`QueryParams`](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/OpenBB-finance/OpenBB/main/openbb_platform/core/openbb_core/provider/abstract/query_params.py)
- [`Data`](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/OpenBB-finance/OpenBB/main/openbb_platform/core/openbb_core/provider/abstract/data.py)

Any parameter or field can be assigned a custom `field_validator`, or the entire model can be passed through a `model_validator` on creation.
See the page on [validators](/odp/python/developer/how-to/validators) for examples.

:::info
- Function signatures prioritize the standard models, provider-specific implementations become `extra_params`.
- Field aliases should be implemented at the model level - i.e., use `__alias_dict__ = {"field": "mapped_field"}`
- Similarly, `json_schema_extra`, should be applied at the model level, `__json_schema_extra__`.
- CamelCase to snake_case is handled automatically.
