Uninstall the Open Data Platform application by selecting `Uninstall` from the tray icon menu.

When confirmed, the process will remove Miniforge, environments, all application data, and optionally, the `OpenBBUserData` and `~./openbb_platform` folders.

:::note
On Windows, using `uninstall.exe` or removing via Control Panel will only remove the GUI. Environments and other files will not be removed.
