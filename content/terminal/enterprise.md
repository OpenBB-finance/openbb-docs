## AI Copilot resources

Users on the free tier will have access to 20 messages per day with the OpenBB Copilot, at which point they will need to insert their LLMs API keys. Enterprise users will benefit from far more generous limits, so they aren't limited.

## File storage resources

Enterprise customers will benefit from up to 10 GB of file (structured/unstructured data) storage, as opposed to 1 GB available with the free tier.
