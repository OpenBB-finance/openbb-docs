<HeadTitle title="Enterprise | OpenBB Workspace Pro Docs" />

Our product offers two different plans:
    - **OpenBB Workspace** - Free version for individuals
    - **OpenBB Enterprise** - Our offering for teams and professionals

The products, features and services that come with an enterprise are highlighted below.

## Excel Add-In

The enterprise plan, enables users to have access to the financial data directly from Excel, or export any dataset into an Excel format.

For more information, check [OpenBB Add-in for Excel](http://docs.openbb.co/excel).

</div>

## Export Data

Users are able to export any data from OpenBB, either in CSV, JSON, XLSX or other format. This is achieved by having redistribution rights on the data.

## Database Integrations

There are two ways to connect to your databases or data warehouses.

1. The first is through custom backends, which we have open source [here](https://github.com/OpenBB-finance/backend-for-terminal-pro/tree/main). This allows users to connect to platforms like Snowflake, Databricks, Elastic, Clickhouse, and others.

2. The second is a native database/datawarehouse integration that enables firms to connect securely with their data, in seconds instead of hours. Supported connections currently include Snowflake, SQLite, and MySQL, with more options coming soon.

## Dashboard Sharing

Keep your dashboards private and securely accessible only to your organization. Upon signing up, we’ll create an organization account for you and your team. You can grant specific team members access to dashboards.

</div>

## Team Management

Gain access to a user management portal where you can manage access to your firm’s workspace. You can invite or remove members, export the entire user list, and view their last login times.

## AI Copilot resources

Users on the free tier will have access to 20 messages per day with the OpenBB Copilot, at which point they will need to insert their LLMs API keys. Enterprise users will benefit from far more generous limits, so they aren't limited.

## File storage resources

Enterprise customers will benefit from up to 10 GB of file (structured/unstructured data) storage, as opposed to 1 GB available with the free tier.
