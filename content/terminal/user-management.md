## Inviting users

To invite users, provide the following details:

- First name
- Last name
- Email address

You can choose to Bypass Invitation, which automatically grants users access to the organization without requiring them to accept an invitation.

There are two ways to invite users:
1. Single User Invitation – Add one user at a time.
2. Bulk Invitation – Recommended for adding multiple users simultaneously.

For bulk invitations, download the provided template, remove the sample data, and add your own. Ensure all mandatory fields are completed before uploading the file.
