<HeadTitle title="GUI API keys | OpenBB Platform Docs" />

The API Keys page in the OpenBB Platform GUI provides a secure and convenient way to manage and store your API credentials for various data providers.

## Key Features

- **Add, Edit, and Remove Keys**: Easily manage your API keys directly within the interface.
- **Secure Local Storage**: Keys are stored securely in your local user settings.
- **Import and Export**: Import keys from `.env` or `.json` files.
- **OpenBB Hub Integration**: Sync your keys with the OpenBB Hub using a Personal Access Token (PAT) to maintain continuity across devices.
- **Search and Filter**: Quickly find specific API keys.
- **View Configuration Files**: Directly open `user_settings.json`, `system_settings.json`, or the `.env` file.
- **Toggle Visibility**: Show or hide API key values for added security.

## Managing API Keys

The main view of the API Keys page displays a list of your configured keys.

- **Add a New Key**: Click the "Add New Key" button to add a new, empty row to the top of the list. You will need to provide a name for the key and its value.
- **Edit a Key**: Both the key name and its value can be edited directly in the list.
- **Remove a Key**: Hover over an API key row to reveal a bin icon, which will remove the key from the list.
- **Save Changes**: After adding, editing, or removing keys, a "Save API Keys" button will appear. Click this to persist your changes to `user_settings.json`.

## Importing Keys

You can import API keys from external files by clicking the "Import Keys" button. Supported formats are:

- **`.json`**: The file can be a flat JSON object of key-value pairs, or it can match the OpenBB settings structure (with keys under a `credentials` object).
- **`.env`**: A standard `.env` file with `KEY=VALUE` pairs.

When importing, new keys are added, and existing keys are updated with the new values from the file.

## Sync with OpenBB Hub

The "Sync with Hub" feature allows you to synchronize your API keys with your OpenBB Hub account. This requires a Personal Access Token (PAT) from the Hub.

- **Fetch Keys from Hub**: Pull your keys from the Hub to the local environment.
- **Remember Token**: You can optionally have the application remember your PAT for future sessions.

## Configuration Files

The "Configuration Files" button provides a convenient way to view the raw setting files:
- `user_settings.json`: Contains user-specific settings, including the API keys managed on this page.
- `system_settings.json`: Contains system-level settings.
- `.env`: For environment-specific variables.

Clicking "Open File" after selecting an option will open the respective file in your default editor.
