# GUI environments

The OpenBB GUI lets you create and manage **isolated Conda¬Æ environments** that run the OpenBB Platform (and anything else you install) without polluting your system-wide Python. Each environment lives inside the OpenBB installation folder, contains its own Python interpreter, packages, and **OpenBB extensions**, and can be deleted at any time.

## Why use environments?

* Keep research projects, prototypes, tutorials, or client deliverables fully isolated.
* Test the upcoming **development** version of OpenBB without touching your daily environment.
* Run multiple Python versions (3.8 ‚Üí 3.12) side-by-side.
* Ship a ready-to-run `requirements.txt`, `pyproject.toml`, or Conda YAML to a colleague ‚Äì they can import it in one click.
* Use it as a lightweight alternative to BQuant/Anaconda for quant notebooks.

---

## Feature overview

Here is a high-level glance at what you can do with the environments screen:

* **Create a new environment** ‚Äì provide a name, pick a Python version, and optionally pre-install OpenBB extensions or any PyPI package.
* **Import from a file** ‚Äì point to a `requirements.txt`, `pyproject.toml`, or Conda YAML and the GUI will reproduce it locally.
* **Manage packages** ‚Äì install, update, or uninstall packages at any time through the *Extensions* side-panel; the action happens inside the selected environment only.
* **Update everything at once** ‚Äì use the *update* button to upgrade **all** installed packages to their latest compatible versions.
* **Work in context** ‚Äì open a system terminal, start an interactive Python or IPython shell, or launch JupyterLab directly in the environment.
* **Choose working directory** ‚Äì define the folder where terminals and notebooks start so your code and data are neatly organised.
* **Delete safely** ‚Äì when an environment is no longer needed it can be removed together with every package it contained.

## Creating a new environment

1. Click **New Environment**.
2. **Name** ‚Äì lower-case letters, numbers & dashes only (`my-research`).
3. **Python version** ‚Äì 3.8 ‚Üí 3.12 (the GUI retrieves pre-built Conda distributions).
4. **Extensions (optional)** ‚Äì search & select any OpenBB extension or enter a PyPI package name.
   * Skip this step to create a *bare* environment.
5. Press **Create Environment**. A progress overlay appears; you can **Cancel Installation** at any point.

!!! tip "Non-blocking UI"
    The GUI streams the installer output in the background; you may continue using other parts of the Platform while the environment is being created.

---

## Importing from an existing spec

Choose **Import Environment** and select **one** of the following files:

* `requirements.txt`
* `pyproject.toml`
* Conda `environment.yml` / `*.yaml`

Then provide an environment name and click **Create Environment**. The GUI uploads the file path to the backend ‚Äì no temporary copies are created.

---

## Working directory

The *Current Working Directory* panel defines where spawned terminals, Python/IPython shells and Jupyter notebooks will start.

* Type a path manually or click the folder icon.
* A ‚úì / ‚ö†Ô∏è indicator shows whether the directory exists (checked via the backend).
* Hit **Enter** or blur the input to save. The preference is persisted across sessions.

## Everyday management

### Environment card actions

* **Extensions** ‚Äì open the panel to list, install, update, or remove packages from this environment.
* **Update** ‚Äì upgrade every installed package in the environment.
* **Open system terminal** ‚Äì launch your default shell with the environment activated and the working directory applied.
* **Start Python session** ‚Äì open an interactive Python prompt that auto-imports `openbb` so you can start experimenting immediately.
* **Start IPython session** ‚Äì available once the package `ipython` is present; provides rich auto-completion and history.
* **Start or open JupyterLab** ‚Äì launch a local Jupyter server in the environment; subsequent clicks open the notebook interface in a window; stop the server when finished.
* **Delete environment** ‚Äì permanently remove the environment after confirmation.

### Extensions panel

* Search packages by name or version.
* **Install** multiple packages at once (uses `pip`).
* **Update** or **Delete** individual packages.
* The GUI caches the extension list per environment in `localStorage` to avoid repetitive backend calls.

---

## Updating an environment

Press **‚Üª Update** on any card. The backend runs:

```bash
conda activate <env> && pip install --upgrade --upgrade-strategy eager <each-package>
```

The card turns grey during the process and re-enables once complete. Errors are shown inline and can be retried.

---

## Removing an environment

1. Click **üóë Delete** on the card.
2. Confirm the dialog ‚Äì the GUI blocks input and shows a spinner.
3. The backend executes `conda env remove -n <env>` and cleans the local cache.

## Troubleshooting & FAQ

| Question | Answer |
| --- | --- |
| "Directory does not exist" | Ensure the path is reachable by the OS user account. Network drives may require additional permissions. |
| "FutureWarning" during install | These are non-fatal; the GUI continues automatically. |
| "Prefix record insertion error" | A known Conda bug ‚Äì the environment is usually created successfully. The GUI handles this automatically. |
| How do I keep a Jupyter server running while I browse other pages? | The GUI tracks active servers and will leave them running until you explicitly stop them. |
| Can I edit `pyproject.toml` after import? | Yes ‚Äì open the Extensions tab and manage packages as usual. |
