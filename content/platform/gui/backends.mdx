# GUI backends

The **Backends** screen lets you run arbitrary application servers (e.g. the `openbb-api`, a FastAPI micro-service, a websocket relay, or a custom Python script) under the control of the OpenBB GUI. Each backend is started inside a selected OpenBB *Environment* and can be stopped, edited, or deleted at any time.

## Why run backends?

* Expose OpenBB REST endpoints locally for Workspace widgets, Excel, or third-party tools.
* Host data pipelines that stream quotes/events to TradingView or dashboards.
* Prototype agent workflows that rely on the [OpenBB MCP](/workspace/ai-agents.md).
* Keep everything **offline** – ideal for air-gapped research labs.

## Feature overview

Below is a summary of everything you can accomplish on the backends screen:

* **Create a backend definition** – provide a name, choose the Conda environment in which the process should run, and supply the executable command. Optional fields let you override host/port, pick a working directory, and attach a `.env` file.
* **Start and stop services** – one click launches the process, another stops it. Status chips show *starting*, *running*, *stopping*, or *error* so you always know what is happening.
* **Enable auto-start** – flag a service to launch automatically when you open the GUI. Combine with the tray-menu option *Start at login* to have backends running after system boot.
* **Live URL detection** – while a backend is booting the GUI scans stdout/stderr, extracts the first HTTP/HTTPS address it prints, and displays it on the card so you can copy it instantly.
* **View logs in real time** – each service can open its own log window. Colour codes are stripped for readability and the window remains alive while the process runs.
* **Edit in place** – change any field (command, environment, working directory, auto-start flag) and save without deleting and recreating the backend.
* **Delete safely** – when a backend is stopped the definition can be removed from disk.

## Creating a backend service

1. Click **New Backend**.
2. Fill the **Backend Name** (required).
3. Select the **Environment** that contains the required packages.
4. **Executable** – anything you would type in a shell, e.g. `openbb-api`, `uvicorn myapp:app --reload`, `python feed.py --ws`.
5. *(Optional)* **Working Directory** – folder from which the command is executed.
6. *(Optional)* **Environment File** – path to a `.env` file whose variables are exported before launch.
7. Enable **Start Automatically** if desired.
8. Press **Create**.

The new backend appears in the list. Use the **Start** button to launch it. While starting, the GUI:

* Streams stdout/stderr and looks for
  * `Started server process [PID]` → saves PID
  * the first `http://` or `https://` → saves URL (host/port auto-extracted)
* If a Python *traceback* or `ERROR:` line is detected, the service is stopped and the card turns red.

!!! tip "Multiple URLs?"
    The GUI waits 1.5 s after the *last* detected URL before persisting it, so frameworks that print several bind addresses are handled gracefully.

## Everyday management

### Card actions

* **Configuration** – expand to edit the backend definition or inspect details such as host, port, working directory, and auto-start flag.
* **Start / stop** – control the lifecycle of the process.
* **Logs** – open a dedicated window that streams stdout/stderr in real time.
* **Copy URL or command** – when the backend is running the URL is copied; when stopped the original command is copied.
* **Delete** – remove the backend definition (only possible when the process is not running).

### Status lifecycle

`stopped → starting → running → stopping → stopped`

`error` is set automatically when the process exits unexpectedly or if a traceback/error is captured during startup.

---

## Auto-start behaviour

* Toggled per backend.
* The setting is stored in the service config (`auto_start`).
* On GUI launch all services flagged *auto-start* are queued; their progress is visible in the list.
* Combine with the tray menu’s **Start at Login** to run headless data services after system boot.

---

## Logs & Monitoring

The GUI registers each backend process with the internal monitor:

```ts
invoke("register_process_monitoring", { processId: `backend-${id}` })
```

That enables:

* Real-time logs via the *Logs* button.
* Automatic error detection and status updates.
* PID tracking for clean shutdown.

## Troubleshooting & FAQ

| Question | Answer |
| --- | --- |
| "Backend stuck at *starting*" | After 20 s a failsafe sets the status to *running*. Check logs to verify the server actually bound a port. |
| Startup traceback | The GUI captures the full traceback and stops the service; open logs for details, fix code, then **Start** again. |
| Port already in use | Edit the backend and change **Port** or stop the conflicting process. |
| How do I expose the API to my LAN? | Edit **Host** to `0.0.0.0` and ensure your firewall allows the chosen port. |
| Can I run non-Python services? | Yes – any executable/script is allowed as long as it runs inside the selected Conda environment. |
