# OpenBB Platform GUI – overview

The **OpenBB Local Installer** ships a cross-platform desktop application (macOS & Windows) that puts the entire OpenBB Platform at your fingertips **without any cloud dependency**. Everything runs **locally**, data never leaves your machine unless you explicitly connect to external APIs.

---

## What you can do

The GUI is divided into three main areas:

* **Backends**: Define and control background servers such as `openbb-api` or any custom script. Start/stop, view logs, enable auto-start, and more. This allows you to utilize this data in the OpenBB Workspace, OpenBB Excel Add-in or a 3rd party application. More in [backends](backends.mdx).
* **Environments**: Create isolated Python installations, install or import packages, and launch terminals or jupyter notebooks (BQuant style). See [environments](environments.mdx) for the full walkthrough.
* **API keys**: Store credentials for data providers securely on your machine. See [API keys](api-keys.mdx).

## Typical workflow

1. **Install** the app and open it.
2. Create a new **Environment**.
3. Spin up the `openbb-api` **Backend** inside that environment.
4. Add your data-provider **API Keys**.
5. Open Workspace in your browser and connect to `http://127.0.0.1:8000`.  You now have a fully local data stack.

## Next steps

* Follow the [Installation guide](installation.mdx) if you haven’t installed the app yet.
* Dive into [Environments](environments.mdx) to set up your first Python stack.
* Configure a **Backend** to expose the REST API or a custom service.
* Add your **API Keys** so endpoints can pull premium data.
