# OpenBB Platform GUI – overview

The **OpenBB Local Installer** ships a cross-platform desktop application (macOS & Windows, Linux via AppImage soon) that puts the entire OpenBB Platform at your fingertips **without any cloud dependency**.  It bundles:

* A Conda distribution pre-configured for finance
* A Tauri-powered GUI written in React/TypeScript
* A lightweight FastAPI backend for OS-level tasks

Everything runs **locally**—data never leaves your machine unless you explicitly connect to external APIs.

---

## What you can do

The GUI is divided into three main areas:

* **Environments** – create isolated Python installations, install or import packages, and launch terminals or notebooks in context. See [environments](environments.mdx) for the full walkthrough.
* **Backends** – define and control background servers such as `openbb-api` or any custom script. Start/stop, view logs, enable auto-start, and more. See [backends](backends.mdx).
* **API keys** – store credentials for data providers securely on your machine and optionally sync them with the OpenBB Hub. See [API keys](api-keys.mdx).

## Key benefits

* **Offline-first** – research anywhere, even without internet.
* **Reproducible** – each project/environment is self-contained; share with colleagues by zipping the folder.
* **One installer** – no Python required on the system; everything lives inside the OpenBB directory.
* **Cross-tool bridging** – expose REST endpoints locally and consume them from Excel, Workspace widgets, or trading bots.
* **Granular control** – choose exactly which packages, versions, and keys are active.

---

## Typical workflow

1. **Install** the app and open it.
2. Create a new **Environment** (Python 3.12 + `openbb-technical`).
3. Spin up the **`openbb-api` Backend** inside that environment.
4. Add your data-provider **API Keys** and (optionally) sync with OpenBB Hub.
5. Open Workspace in your browser and connect to `http://127.0.0.1:8000`.  You now have a fully local data stack.

## Next steps

* Follow the [Installation guide](installation.mdx) if you haven’t installed the app yet.
* Dive into [Environments](environments.mdx) to set up your first Python stack.
* Configure a **Backend** to expose the REST API or a custom service.
* Add your **API Keys** so endpoints can pull premium data.
