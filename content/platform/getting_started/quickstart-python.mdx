To get started with the OpenBB Platform, all you need to do is to import `obb` and start querying away.

```python
from openbb import obb

# Get the price of a stock
quote_data = obb.equity.price.quote(symbol="AAPL", provider="yfinance")
quote_data
```

The output will look like this:

```console
OBBject

id: 06649f4e-896c-7b31-8000-52242b1605f2
results: [{'symbol': 'AAPL', 'asset_type': 'EQUITY', 'name': 'Apple Inc.', 'exchang...
provider: yfinance
warnings: None
chart: None
extra: {'metadata': {'arguments': {'provider_choices': {'provider': 'yfinance'}, 's...
```

To view the output as a dataframe, you can use the `to_df()` method.

```python
quote_data.to_df()
```

Let's try another example. This time, we'll get the historical price of a stock.

```python
obb.equity.price.historical(symbol="AAPL", provider="yfinance").to_df()
```

To view all the available commands, routers and extensions, you can do:

```python
obb
```

You can also keep exploring by accessing each route like this:

```python
obb.equity
```

If you see a command you're interested in, to get help on how to use it, you can do:

```python
help(obb.equity.price.historical)
```

Visit our [reference](/platform/reference) documentation to see all the available commands and their parameters.

And that's it! You're now ready to start using the OpenBB Platform.
