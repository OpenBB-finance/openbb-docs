<HeadTitle title="Quickstart - Workspace Custom Backend | OpenBB Platform Docs" />

The OpenBB Platform can be used as a [Workspace custom backend](/terminal/custom-backend), both as a fully-loaded data source, or as the bare shell and launcher of a FastAPI application.

The sections below will outline a few scenarios.

## Launch Platform App

To include all installed OpenBB extensions as widgets in the custom backend connector:

:::info
Open a terminal, activate the environment where `openbb` was installed, then enter:

```sh
openbb-api
```
:::

- Next, open your browswer and login to [pro.openbb.co](https://pro.openbb.co).

- From the sidebar, click "Data Connectors".

- Then, click the "Add Data" button.

![Add Data](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/770e6d6c-6cd7-4073-a874-af0850f404cc)

- Enter a name for the connection, and use the server address displayed in the console.

- Then, click the "Test" button.

:::tip
If a connection error displays after pressing the "Test" button, your browser might be blocking access because of "mixed content". Browsers such as Safari, and Brave, do not permit HTTP connections.

Try using Chrome, specifically, or start the server over HTTPS.

See the page [here](/terminal/custom-backend#frequently-asked-questions) for the steps to do it.
:::

- Finally, click the "Add" button.

All data endpoints are now configured to use and are available to the Search.

## Launch Custom Platform App

Let's say, you want to create a custom backend that presents data differently, and you don't want any of the built-in widgets to populate.

In this scenario, we can use the `--exclude` argument to ignore the entire `/api/*` path.

Widgets will now only populate from endpoints added to the imported `app` instance.

```python
from openbb_platform_api.main import app

from openbb import obb


@app.get("/company_description")
async def company_description(symbol: str = "AAPL") -> str:
    """Reference data for the given company using yFinance."""
    response = obb.equity.profile(symbol, provider="yfinance")

    description = response.results[0].long_description

    md = f"""

# **{response.results[0].name}**
## **{response.results[0].sector}**
### **{response.results[0].industry_category}**

<details>
<summary mdxType="summary">Company Description</summary>
{description}
</details>

{response.results[0].company_url}
"""
    return md
```

Launch the backend by including the path to the Python file as the `--app` argument.

```sh
openbb-api --app /Users/path/to/some/folder/some_file.py --exclude '"/api/v1/*"' --reload
```
