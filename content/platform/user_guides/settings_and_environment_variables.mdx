This page outlines configuring the OpenBB Platform with user settings and environment variables.

## User Settings

User settings are stored locally, `~/.openbb_platform/`, as a JSON file, `user_settings.json`. It is read upon initializing the Python client, or when the Fast API is authorized. If the file does not exist, it will be created on the first run.

This file stores:

- [credentials](/platform/getting_started/api_keys#local-environment)
- [preferences](#preferences)
- [defaults](#defaults)

This is an example of how it might look after setup:

```json
{
    "credentials": {
        "fmp_api_key": "REPLACE",
        "polygon_api_key": "REPLACE",
    },
    "preferences": {
        "data_directory": "~/OpenBBUserData",
        "export_directory": "~/OpenBBUserData/exports",
        "request_timeout": 15,
        "metadata": true,
        "output_type": "OBBject"
    },
    "defaults": {
        "commands": {
            "/equity/price/historical": {
                "provider": "fmp"
            },
            "/equity/fundamental/balance": {
                "provider": [
                    "intrinio",
                    "fmp",
                    "polygon"
                ]
            },
        }
    }
}
```

### Preferences

| **Preference**        | **Default**                      | **Options**                                                         | **Description**                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          |

:::note

- If a `OpenBBUserData` folder in not in the home directory, the application will create one on first run. The user preferences with paths all default to this folder - exports, styles, or data - and can be changed at any time to suit.
- The `OpenBBUserData` will still be created even if preferences are not pointing to it, this is because the application needs a place to store logs and other artifacts.
- One way to export files or images from the OpenBB Platform is to leverage that functionality from the OpenBB Charting Extension. The `export_directory` preference is the location where the extension will attempt to save CSV and image files.

### Defaults

Here you can define provider defaults, and other parameters, for Python commands, if no argument is explicitly sent when the command runs. For 'provider', there are two formatting options:

1. **Single provider**: this provider will be selected by default for the given command.
2. **Priority list**: the first provider in the list with all required credentials setup will be used.

```json
{
    ...
    "defaults": {
        "commands": {
            // single provider //
            "/equity/price/historical": {
                "provider": "fmp"
            },
            # priority list
            "/equity/fundamental/balance": {
                "provider": [
                    "intrinio",
                    "fmp",
                    "polygon"
                ]
            },
        }
    }
}
```

:::note

- If no configuration is specified the command will use the default priority list. This is the list of available providers for the command sorted alphabetically.

:::

#### Query Parameters

Individual parameters can also be defined in `user_settings.json`, and the values supplied will applied at runtime.
The default will be ignored when the parameter is passed in the function call.

```json
{
    ...
    "defaults": {
        "commands": {
            "/equity/price/historical": {
                "provider": "yfinance",
                "chart": true,
                "chart_params": {
                    "heikin_ashi": true,
                    "indicators": {
                        "sma": {
                            "length": [
                                21,
                                50
                            ]
                        },
                        "ema": {
                            "length": 150
                        }
                    }
                }
            },
            "/economy/cpi": {
                "provider": "oecd"
            }
        }
    }
}
```

:::important
- Default parameters are somewhat limited in the FastAPI. Apart from 'provider', they are applicable only where parameters have been defined as Optional, with a default value of None.

- Command docstrings and descriptions will not change according to items defined here.
:::

## Environment Variables

Environment variables are defined in a `.env` file. If this file does not exist, create it inside the same folder `user_settings.json` is located.

- `OPENBB_DEBUG_MODE`: enables verbosity while running the program
- `OPENBB_AUTO_BUILD`: enables automatic SDK package build on import
- `OPENBB_API_AUTH_EXTENSION`: specifies which API authentication extension to use
- `OPENBB_API_AUTH`: enables API authentication for command endpoints
- `OPENBB_API_USERNAME`: sets API username
- `OPENBB_API_PASSWORD`: sets API password

Variables can be defined for current session only.

```python
import os
os.environ["OPENBB_DEBUG_MODE"] = "True"
from openbb import obb
````

### Proxy Networks

An environment variable can be set, in the `.env` file, to direct the Requests library to a specific address and port.

```env
HTTP_PROXY="<ADDRESS>" or HTTPS_PROXY="<ADDRESS>”
```

For example:

```env
HTTP_PROXY="http://10.10.10.10:8000"
```

## System Settings

An additional configuration file, `system_settings.json`, is located in the same folder as `user_settings.json`, and can be created manually if it does not exist. The items below can be configured via this file.

### Python Settings

This configuration allows the user to include specific elements of the docstrings. Useful for reducing the context length when incorporating LLMs and function calling. The settings below are for the complete docstring, and are the default state.

```json
{
    "python_settings": {
        "docstring_sections": ["description", "parameters", "returns", "examples"],
        "docstring_max_length": null
    }
}
```

### API Settings

This dictionary is passed to the instance of FastAPI. 

```json
{
    "api_settings": {
        "version": "1",
        "title": "OpenBB Platform API",
        "description": "This is the OpenBB Platform API.",
        "terms_of_service": "http://example.com/terms/",
        "contact_name": "OpenBB Team",
        "contact_url": "https://openbb.co",
        "contact_email": "hello@openbb.co",
        "license_name": "AGPLv3",
        "license_url": "https://github.com/OpenBB-finance/OpenBB/blob/develop/LICENSE",
        "servers": [
            {
                "url": "",
                "description": "Local OpenBB development server"
            }
        ],
        "cors": {
            "allow_origins": [
                "*"
            ],
            "allow_methods": [
                "*"
            ],
            "allow_headers": [
                "*"
            ]
        },
        "prefix": "/api/v1"
    }
}
```

### Logging Service

The OpenBB Platform logs anonymized records of function calls, and any error messages produced, to a unique file for the session, written to `~/OpenBBUserData/logs`.

There are two settings that can be applied:

- log_collect: Set as false to disable telemetry while still logging locally to file.
- logging_suppress: Disables the file handler in the logging service and no log records are created.

```json
{
    "logging_suppress": true,
    "log_collect": false
}
```
