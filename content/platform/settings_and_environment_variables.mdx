<HeadTitle title="User Settings & Environment Variables | OpenBB Platform Docs" />

This page outlines configuring the OpenBB Platform with user settings and environment variables.

## User Settings

User settings are stored locally, `~/.openbb_platform/`, as a JSON file, `user_settings.json`. It is read upon initializing the Python client, or when the Fast API is authorized. If the file does not exist, it will be created on the first run.

This file stores:

- [credentials](api_keys#local-environment)
- [preferences](#preferences)
- [defaults](#defaults)

This is an example of how it might look after setup:

```json
{
    "credentials": {
        "fmp_api_key": "REPLACE",
        "polygon_api_key": "REPLACE",
    },
    "preferences": {
        "data_directory": "~/OpenBBUserData",
        "export_directory": "~/OpenBBUserData/exports",
        "metadata": true,
        "output_type": "OBBject"
    },
    "defaults": {
        "commands": {
            "/equity/price/historical": {
                "provider": "fmp"
            },
            "/equity/fundamental/balance": {
                "provider": [
                    "intrinio",
                    "fmp",
                    "polygon"
                ]
            },
        }
    }
}
```

### Preferences

| **Preference**        | **Default**                      | **Options**                                                         | **Description**                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          |

:::note

- If an `OpenBBUserData` folder is not in the home directory, the application will create one on first run. The user preferences with paths all default to this folder - exports, styles, or data - and can be changed at any time to suit.
- The `OpenBBUserData` will still be created even if preferences are not pointing to it, this is because the application needs a place to store logs and other artifacts.
- One way to export files or images from the OpenBB Platform is to leverage that functionality from the OpenBB Charting Extension. The `export_directory` preference is the location where the extension will attempt to save CSV and image files.

:::

### Defaults

Here you can define provider defaults, and other parameters, for Python commands, if no argument is explicitly sent when the command runs. For 'provider', there are two formatting options:

1. **Single provider**: this provider will be selected by default for the given command.
2. **Priority list**: the first provider in the list with all required credentials setup will be used.

```json
{
    ...
    "defaults": {
        "commands": {
            "/equity/price/historical": {
                "provider": "yfinance"
            },
            "/equity/fundamental/balance": {
                "provider": [
                    "yfinance",
                    "fmp",
                    "polygon"
                ]
            },
        }
    }
}
```

:::note

- If no configuration is specified the command will use the default priority list. This is the list of available providers for the command sorted alphabetically.

:::

#### Query Parameters

Individual parameters can also be defined in `user_settings.json`, and the values supplied will applied at runtime.
The default will be ignored when the parameter is passed in the function call.

```json
{
    ...
    "defaults": {
        "commands": {
            "/equity/price/historical": {
                "provider": "yfinance",
                "chart": true,
                "chart_params": {
                    "heikin_ashi": true,
                    "indicators": {
                        "sma": {
                            "length": [
                                21,
                                50
                            ]
                        },
                        "ema": {
                            "length": 150
                        }
                    }
                }
            },
            "/economy/cpi": {
                "provider": "oecd"
            }
        }
    }
}
```

:::important
- Default parameters are somewhat limited in the FastAPI. Apart from 'provider', they are applicable only where parameters have been defined as Optional, with a default value of None.

- Command docstrings and descriptions will not change according to items defined here.
:::

## Environment Variables

Environment variables are defined in a `.env` file. If this file does not exist, create it inside the same folder `user_settings.json` is located.

- `OPENBB_DEBUG_MODE`: enables verbosity while running the program
- `OPENBB_DEV_MODE`: applicable to the API; exposes, /system and /user, paths.
- `OPENBB_AUTO_BUILD`: enables automatic SDK package build on import
- `OPENBB_API_AUTH_EXTENSION`: specifies which API authentication extension to use
- `OPENBB_API_AUTH`: enables API authentication for command endpoints
- `OPENBB_API_USERNAME`: sets API username
- `OPENBB_API_PASSWORD`: sets API password

Variables can be defined for current session only.

```python
import os
os.environ["OPENBB_DEBUG_MODE"] = "True"
from openbb import obb
````

### Proxy Networks

See the [HTTP settings](settings_and_environment_variables#http) below for how to define the proxy url.

## System Settings

An additional configuration file, `system_settings.json`, is located in the same folder as `user_settings.json`, and can be created manually if it does not exist. The items below can be configured via this file, as a JSON dictionary.

## API Settings

The, `"api_settings"`, key is a nested dictionary, and is passed to the instance of FastAPI. 

```json
{
    "api_settings": {
        "version": "1",
        "title": "OpenBB Platform API",
        "description": "This is the OpenBB Platform API.",
        "terms_of_service": "http://example.com/terms/",
        "contact_name": "OpenBB Team",
        "contact_url": "https://openbb.co",
        "contact_email": "hello@openbb.co",
        "license_name": "AGPLv3",
        "license_url": "https://github.com/OpenBB-finance/OpenBB/blob/develop/LICENSE",
        "servers": [
            {
                "url": "",
                "description": "Local OpenBB development server"
            }
        ],
        "cors": {
            "allow_origins": [
                "*"
            ],
            "allow_methods": [
                "*"
            ],
            "allow_headers": [
                "*"
            ]
        },
        "prefix": "/api/v1"
    }
}
```

## Logging Service

The OpenBB Platform logs anonymized records of function calls, and any error messages produced, to a unique file for the session, written to `~/OpenBBUserData/logs`.

There are two settings that can be applied:

- log_collect: Set as false to disable telemetry while still logging locally to file.
- logging_suppress: Disables the file handler in the logging service and no log records are created.

```json
{
    "logging_suppress": true,
    "log_collect": false
}
```


## Python Settings

The `python_settings` key is a nested dictionary. It contains configurations for the docstring elements within the Python interface, as well as global HTTP and Uvicorn settings.

Additional keys and values can be supplied, however, unless they are specifically implemented by custom code, they will be ignored.

### Docstring Sections

This configuration allows the user to include specific elements of the docstrings. Useful for reducing the context length when incorporating LLMs and function calling. The settings below are for the complete docstring, and are the default state.

```json
{
    "python_settings": {
        "docstring_sections": ["description", "parameters", "returns", "examples"],
        "docstring_max_length": null
    }
}
```

### HTTP

:::important
This section refers to settings available beginning OpenBB v4.4.0
:::

Configurations within, `python_settings["http"]`, apply to both, the requests, and aiohttp, libraries.

The settings are passed into the `requests.Session` object and the `aiohttp.ClientSession` object by:
- `openbb_core.provider.utils.helpers.make_request` - Sync
- `openbb_core.provider.utils.helpers.amake_request` - Async
- `openbb_core.provider.utils.helpers.amake_requests` - Async (multiple requests)
- Inserted to use with YFinance & Finviz library implementations.

Return a session object with the settings applied by:
- `openbb_core.provider.utils.helpers.get_requests_session`
- `openbb_core.provider.utils.helpers.get_async_requests_session`

:::tip
Pass the session object, returned by `get_requests_session`, to use this configuration directly with the yFinance library.

```python
import yfinance as yf
from openbb_core.provider.utils.helpers import get_requests_session

session = get_requests_session()
ticker = yf.Ticker("AAPL", session=session)
```
:::

#### Available settings:

| Key | Type | Description |
|:----|:----:|------------:|
|cafile| str | Path to a CA certificate file.|
|certfile| str | Path to a client certificate file.|
|keyfile| str | Path to a client key file.|
|password| str | Password for the client key file (aiohttp only).|
|verify_ssl| bool | Verify SSL certificates.|
|fingerprint| str | SSL fingerprint (aiohttp only).|
|proxy| str | Proxy URL.|
|proxy_auth| str, list | Proxy basic authentication (aiohttp only).|
|proxy_headers| dict | Proxy headers (aiohttp only).|
|timeout| int | Request timeout.|
|auth| str, list | Basic authentication.|
|headers| dict | Request headers.|
|cookies| dict | Dictionary of session cookies.|

Any additional keys supplied will be ignored unless explicitly implemented via custom code.

### Uvicorn

The, `python_settings["uvicorn"]`, key covers the launch of FastAPI when using the following entry points:

- Running the FastAPI as a Python module script.
    - python -m openbb_core.api.rest_api
- Running the `openbb-api` command.
    - openbb-api

All settings are passed directly to `uvicorn.run`, and can be found in the Uvicorn [documentation](https://www.uvicorn.org/settings/)

:::important
Keyword arguments supplied to the command line will take priority over the settings in this configuration.
