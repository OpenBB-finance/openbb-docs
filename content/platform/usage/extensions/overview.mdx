The extension framework allows individual pieces to be installed and removed seamlessly within the environment, using only the desired data and toolkit extensions.

There are two primary types of extensions for the OpenBB Platform:

- Data
- Toolkits

The OpenBB Core installation does not include any toolkit extensions. Install the OpenBB Platform with all data and toolkit extensions from PyPI with:

```python
pip install openbb[all]
```

When installing from source, navigate into the `openbb_platform` folder from the root of the project and enter:

```console
python dev_install.py -e
```

This installs all extensions in editable mode, and the Python interface is compiled in, `/openbb_platform/openbb/package`, instead of the environment's `site-packages` folder. The tables in the next pages lists extensions as either, Core or Community. The Core extensions are installed by default.

A couple of notable differences between data and toolkit extension are:

- In the OpenBB GitHub repo, extensions are all located under:

    ```console
    ~/OpenBB/openbb_platform/extensions
    ```

- An additional folder housing integration tests, with the `tests` folder staying empty.
- There is a `router` file, and there can be sub-folders with additional routers.
- Utility functions don't need their own sub-folder.
- `__init__.py` files are all empty.

:::important When an extension is installed or uninstalled, the Python interface will need to rebuild the static assets for the app to fully reflect the changes.

To invoke the build process, enter the line below from the command line:

```sh
openbb-build
```

Or

```sh
python -c "import openbb;openbb.build()"
```

This is not necessary when using the API, changes will be reflected on the next run.
