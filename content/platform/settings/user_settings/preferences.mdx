User settings are stored locally, `~/.openbb_platform/`, as a JSON file, `user_settings.json`. It is read upon initializing the Python client, or when the Fast API is authorized. If the file does not exist, it will be created on the first run.

This file stores:

- [credentials](api_keys#local-environment)
- [preferences](#preferences)
- [defaults](defaults)

This is an example of how it might look after setup:

```json
{
    "credentials": {
        "fmp_api_key": "REPLACE",
        "polygon_api_key": "REPLACE",
    },
    "preferences": {
        "data_directory": "~/OpenBBUserData",
        "export_directory": "~/OpenBBUserData/exports",
        "metadata": true,
        "output_type": "OBBject"
    },
    "defaults": {
        "commands": {
            "/equity/price/historical": {
                "provider": "fmp"
            },
            "/equity/fundamental/balance": {
                "provider": [
                    "intrinio",
                    "fmp",
                    "polygon"
                ]
            },
        }
    }
}
```

:::note

- If an `OpenBBUserData` folder is not in the home directory, the application will create one on first run. The user preferences with paths all default to this folder - exports, styles, or data - and can be changed at any time to suit.
- The `OpenBBUserData` will still be created even if preferences are not pointing to it, this is because the application needs a place to store logs and other artifacts.
- One way to export files or images from the OpenBB Platform is to leverage that functionality from the OpenBB Charting Extension. The `export_directory` preference is the location where the extension will attempt to save CSV and image files.
