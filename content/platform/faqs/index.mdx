<summary mdxType="summary">Endpoints that are displayed in this documentation are not found when I try to use them.</summary>

The [Reference](/platform/reference) pages are created from the contents of our GitHub [repo](https://github.com/OpenBB-finance/OpenBB), and may not match your installation.

If a router/endpoint appears to be missing from your installation, it is quite likely that it is not installed. It may also be that the functions are served by provider extensions that require API keys. The function will not be added to the application unless a value has been supplied, or there is another provider which does not require authorization.

See the page [here](/platform/user_guides/extensions) for a current list of data provider extensions.
