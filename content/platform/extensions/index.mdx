# Installable Packages & Extensions

OpenBB Platform is the combination of packages installed in an environment. The core package is the underlying infrastructure, while extensions represent API routes, data sources, and the response object.



When you run, `pip install openbb`, you get all of the extensions maintained in the official OpenBB GitHub [repository](https://www.github.com/OpenBB-finance/OpenBB). You can create your own custom Python apps by extending the `openbb-core` library, or by selectively installing individual components.

Anyone can build and publish an OpenBB Platform extension, 

- see the [developer docs](/platform/developer_guide) for details -

Always follow best-practice when installing software on a machine. Compatibility, integrity, and security of third-party packages or distributions has not been verified or endorsed by OpenBB.
