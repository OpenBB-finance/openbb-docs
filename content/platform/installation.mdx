## General System Requirements

Most systems capable of running Python 3.9.21-3.12 will be compatible with the OpenBB Platform. A modern processor (five years or less), running an up-to-date operating system, with at least 4GB of RAM, is recommended. Maintaining the system with current patches ensures maximum compatibility. At a minimum, Windows and macOS should be:

- Windows 10
- Mac OS Big Sur

Linux users should run the command line update for the package manager, prior to installation.

## Installer Package

An installer package is available for Mac and Windows machines. Files are available [here](https://my.openbb.co/app/platform/downloads).

It will handle the installation of Python, environment setup, and OpenBB packages with the latest versions.

:::danger
Users with v1.0.0 installations need to follow the steps below to update the version of OpenBB.

1. In Finder/Explorer, open the folder where it was installed - probably in a folder, named "OpenBB", at the root of the operating system user account.
2. From the main installation folder, navigate into the subdirectory, "extensions/openbb_platform_installer".
3. Open, "pyproject.toml", in any text editor, and update two lines:
  - Line 18:
    - From: python =">3.9,<3.13"
    - To: python = ">=3.9.21,<3.13"
  - Line 21:
    - From: openbb-core = "^1"
    - To: openbb-core = ">=1.4.4"
4. Save the file, close it, and then run the "Update" shortcut.
:::

## Supported Environments

The OpenBB Platform is installed within a Python virtual environment. It is compatible with versions of Python between 3.9.21 and 3.12, inclusively. The method for creating the environment will be a matter of user preference, from the command line - [Conda](https://docs.conda.io/projects/miniconda/en/latest/miniconda-install.html), [venv](https://docs.python.org/3/library/venv.html), etc. - or in a code editor and IDE - [VS Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/languages/python), [PyCharm](https://www.jetbrains.com/pycharm/), [Jupyter](https://jupyter.org/).

If you're interested in using the [Docker](/platform/installation#docker) container, skip ahead to the specific section [below](/platform/installation#docker).

For those new to Python, [this article](https://www.infoworld.com/article/3306656/python-virtualenv-and-venv-dos-and-donts.html) shares some tips on getting started and why environments are important.

See [this guide](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/python/environments) for creating a Python environment in VS Code.

With the environment created, and activated, begin the installation process.

## Installation

Before installation, update the package manager so that `pip` is current, then create the environment with the desired version of Python.

:::note
Installing packages directly to the system Python or `base` environment is not recommended. Create a new environment first (can be any name, using openbb here for example).

```bash
conda create -n openbb python=3.12
conda activate openbb
```

:::

### PyPI

<details>
Install from PyPI with:

```console
pip install openbb
```

This will install the core OpenBB Platform, along with officially supported extensions and providers.

To install all extensions and providers (both officially supported and community maintained ones):

```console
pip install openbb[all]
```

:::tip
In a macOS `zsh` Terminal shell, add quotation marks around the library name.

`"openbb[all]"`
:::

From your python interpreter, import the OpenBB Platform:

```console
from openbb import obb
```

:::warning
This import statement is required due to the statefulness of the obb package. There is currently no support for imports such as:

```console
from openbb.obb.equity import *
```

:::

When the package is imported, any installed extensions will be discovered, imported and available for use.

:::note
Currently if you wish to have the bare-bones openbb package with no extensions or providers, you can install with:

```console
pip install openbb-core && pip install openbb --no-deps
```

To install single extensions:

```console
pip install openbb-charting
```

```console
pip install openbb-technical
```

Or install a single provider:

```console
pip install openbb-yfinance
```

Providers are fully functional by themselves, but the interface routes are only added when the router extensions are installed.

```console
pip install openbb-equity openbb-index openbb-derivatives
```

:::


To update the package:

```console
pip install --upgrade openbb
```

To update all extensions and providers:

```console
pip install --upgrade openbb[all]
```

If you want to uninstall the package and all its dependencies:

```console
pip uninstall openbb[all]
```

</details>

### Docker

<details>
We provide a `platformAPI.Dockerfile` on [GitHub](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/OpenBB-finance/OpenBB/refs/heads/develop/build/docker/platformAPI.Dockerfile).

Run the following command from the repo root to build the image:

```bash
docker build -f build/docker/platformAPI.Dockerfile -t openbb-platform:latest .
```

To run it:

```bash
docker run -it --rm -p 6900:6900 -v ~/.openbb_platform:/root/.openbb_platform openbb-platform:latest
```

This will mount the local `~/.openbb_platform` directory into the Docker container to use with the API keys and preferences from there, and it will expose the API on port `6900`.

</details>

### Source

To install from source, create a Python virtual environment and update `pip` and `setuptools`, within the newly created environment, **before** installing any packages.

<details>
To build the OpenBB Platform from the source code, first install `git`:

```console
pip install git
```

Next, clone the repository from GitHub:

```console
git clone git@github.com:OpenBB-finance/OpenBB.git
```

When it is done, checkout the branch where the code is living:

```console
git checkout develop
```

Then, `cd` into the directory:

```console
cd openbb_platform
```

Install required packages

```console
pip install poetry
```

Finally, run the developer installation script:

```console
python dev_install.py
```

:::note
To install all extensions and providers, run: `python dev_install.py -e`
:::

</details>

## Post-Installation

With a fresh installation, and upon installing or uninstalling extensions, the Python interface needs to be built. This is done automatically, but can be manually triggered if required. Start a Python session and import openbb:

```console
python
```

```python
from openbb import obb

exit()
```

To manually trigger the build:

```python
import openbb
openbb.build()
```

Restart the Python interpreter and then begin using the OpenBB Platform.

```python
from openbb import obb
```

Start the REST API with:

```console
uvicorn openbb_core.api.rest_api:app --host 0.0.0.0 --port 8000 --reload
```

See more information about using the REST API in the [usage section](/platform/user_guides/rest_api)

## Hub Synchronization

Once you have installed the OpenBB Platform with the desired providers and extensions, you can synchronize with the [OpenBB Hub](https://my.openbb.co/app/hub). The main benefit of this is that you can use your single login to access your saved credentials and preferences from any instance. To login, you can use the `login` method, either using your email and password:

```python
obb.account.login(email='my_email_here', password='my_password_here')
```

Or using your personal access token:

```python
obb.account.login(pat='my_pat_here')
```
