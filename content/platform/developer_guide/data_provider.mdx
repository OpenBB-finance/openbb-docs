</div>

## Getting Started

An easy way to get started is to copy and paste something existing. In the OpenBB GitHub repository, provider extensions are located [here](https://github.com/OpenBB-finance/OpenBB/tree/develop/openbb_platform/providers).

For convenience's sake, download this template [zip file](https://github.com/OpenBB-finance/OpenBB/files/14519701/provider_extension_template.zip). It contains the basic folder structure and everything required to get started creating new data models.

For demonstration purposes, we'll assume this is from the perspective of somebody who will open a pull request and contribute the code to the OpenBB repository. The process, however, also applies to publishing directly via PyPI. Anyone can make an OpenBB extension.

The structure of the folder will look something like this:

```md
template/
├── openbb_template/
│ ├── models/
│ │ ├── __init__.py
│ │ └── some_model.py
│ ├── utils/
│ │ ├── __init__.py
│ │ └── helpers.py
│ ├── tests/
│ │ ├── record/
│ │ ├── __init__.py
│ │ └── test_template_fetchers.py
│ ├── __init__.py
├── __init__.py
├── pyproject.toml
└── README.md
```

The `__init__.py` file where models are mapped to the router is under, `/openbb_template`.

To get started:

- Unpack the downloaded [zip](ttps://github.com/OpenBB-finance/OpenBB/files/14519701/provider_extension_template.zip) file.

  - If working with a cloned GitHub repo, the folder is:

  ```console
  ~/OpenBB/openbb_platform/providers
  ```

- Rename everything, "template", to suit. File names, models, import statements, docstrings.
- Add any provider-specific package requirements in the `pyproject.toml` file.
- Update the Provider information in the `__init__.py` file.
  - If credentials are required, add a line to the Provider class initialization.

  ```python
  credentials=["api_key", "account_type"], # account_type is either "sandbox" or "live"
  ```

- From a terminal command line, navigate into the folder where the extension is, then install the empty blank package in "editable" mode.

  ```console
  poetry lock
  pip install -e .
  ```

- Start creating data models using the steps outlined [here](add_data_to_existing_endpoint)

### Cookiecutter

In order to speed up the process of building an extension, we have created a [**Cookiecutter**](https://github.com/OpenBB-finance/openbb-cookiecutter) template.

It serves as a jumpstart for your extension development, and can be used instead of the template ZIP referenced earlier. Instructions are located on the [GitHub page](https://github.com/OpenBB-finance/openbb-cookiecutter).

:::note
The cookiecutter tool will get you most of the way there, but it still requires some tweaks to the file names and initializations.
:::

ver are typically included as, XAU and XAG, respectively.


## Provider module


Below is the contents from the template's `__init__.py` file, modified to create a provider extension for [Tradier](https://documentation.tradier.com/brokerage-api/overview/endpoints).

```python
"""Tradier Provider Module."""

from openbb_core.provider.abstract.provider import Provider
from openbb_tradier.models.options_chains import TradierOptionsChainsFetcher

tradier_provider = Provider(
    name="tradier",
    website="https://tradier.com",
    description= "Tradier provides a full range of services in a scalable, secure,"
        + " and easy-to-use REST-based API for businesses and individual developers."
        + " Fast, secure, simple. Start in minutes."
        + " Get access to trading, account management, and market-data for"
        + " Tradier Brokerage accounts through our APIs.",
    credentials=["api_key", "account_type"], # account_type is either "sandbox" or "live"
    fetcher_dict={
        "OptionsChains": TradierOptionsChainsFetcher,
    },
)
```

Note: Access to most data sources is authorized with an API key, issued by the source. Sometimes there are multiple authorization fields, and other times there may be a need to change the base URL depending on the type of account.

> If no authorization is required, leave out the 'credentials' parameter.

### Rebuild python interface and assets

The application will need to rebuild the static files in order to recognize any changes to the `fetcher_dict` in the `__init__.py` file.

This is also required to reflect any changes to parameters, docstrings and function signatures.

Open a terminal, start a new Python session, then enter:

```python
import openbb

openbb.build()

exit()
```

The updated endpoint's function signature will now display the additional provider.

```python
Signature:
obb.derivatives.options.chains(
    symbol: typing.Annotated[str, OpenBBField(description='Symbol to get data for.')],
    provider: Optional[Literal['cboe', 'intrinio', 'tmx', 'tradier']] = None,
    **kwargs,
) -> openbb_core.app.model.obbject.OBBject
```


## Dependencies

The `pyproject.toml` file defines the package itself.

:::tip

- Before adding any dependency, ensure it aligns with the Platform's existing dependencies.
- If possible, use loose versioning.

  :::

```toml
[tool.poetry]
name = "openbb-template"
version = "1.0.0"
description = "Template Provider Extension for the OpenBB Platform"
authors = ["Name <my@emailaddress.com>"]
readme = "README.md"
packages = [{ include = "openbb_template" }]

[tool.poetry.dependencies]
python = ">=3.8,<3.12"
openbb = "^4.1.7"

[build-system]
requires = ["poetry-core"]
build-backend = "poetry.core.masonry.api"

[tool.poetry.plugins."openbb_provider_extension"]
template = "openbb_template:template_provider"
```

The last line (poetry.plugins) maps to the provider defined in the `__init__.py` file.

Additionally, for local extensions, you can add this line in the `LOCAL_DEPS` variable in the `dev_install.py` file, located in `~/OpenBB/openbb_platform/`:

```toml
# If this is a community dependency, add this under "Community dependencies",
# with additional argument optional = true
openbb-extension = { path = "<relative-path-to-the-extension>", develop = true }
```

Now you can use the `python dev_install.py [-e]` command to install the local extension.


## Standard Model

The essence of a standard model is to be a shared resource with common ground between all sources.
It should not be so specific that it is relevant only to one provider, and it needs to have defining characteristics that warrant its existence.

Mandatory fields and parameters should be minimal, and names need to be consistent with similar ones across the OpenBB Platform. If in doubbt, contact the OpenBB team.

### File Structure

We're going to map this new endpoint in the interface to, `obb.currency.snapshots()`. We'll name the model accordingly, `CurrencySnapshots`, and create a file, `currency_snapshots.py`. The file should be created here:

```console
~/OpenBB/openbb_platform/core/openbb_core/provider/standard_models/
```

The first line of the file should be a docstring, the second line should be empty, and the import statements follow.

The code block below are the typical imports in a standard model file, modify to suit the specific requirements.

:::tip

Constrained types can be imported from the Pydantic library, i.e. `PositiveInt`, `NonNegativeFloat`, etc.

:::

<details>
<summary mdxType="summary">File imports</summary>

```python
"""Currency Snapshots Standard Model."""

from typing import Literal, Optional

from pydantic import Field, field_validator

from openbb_core.provider.abstract.data import Data
from openbb_core.provider.abstract.query_params import QueryParams
from openbb_core.provider.utils.descriptions import DATA_DESCRIPTIONS
```
</details>

### Standard QueryParams

Don't try to add every possible parameter unless it is certain that the majority of providers will have this available from their API.
The same applies to `Literal` types, set as a generic `str` or `int` type and redefine it within the provider model as a `Literal["choice1", "choice2"]`.
We don't want a standard model parameter to provide invalid choices for individual providers.

Our `CurrencySnapshotsQueryParams` model is going to be very similar to `MarketSnapshotsQueryParams`, with the only difference being the field name "base".

:::important

If the field will only sometimes accept a list of values, DO NOT define it in the standard model as a Union - `Union[str, List[str]]`.
Instead, define it for the single value, `str`, and then add the property below to the provider's QueryParams model.

```python
__json_schema_extra__ = {"base": ["multiple_items_allowed"]}
```

:::

<details>
<summary mdxType="summary">Code example</summary>

The code block below is a continuation of the section above.

```python
class CurrencySnapshotsQueryParams(QueryParams):
    """Currency Snapshots Query Params."""

    base: str = Field(description="The base currency symbol.", default="usd")
    quote_type: Literal["direct", "indirect"] = Field(
        description="Whether the quote is direct or indirect."
        + " Selecting 'direct' will return the exchange rate"
        + " as the amount of domestic currency required to buy one unit"
        + " of the foreign currency."
        + " Selecting 'indirect' (default) will return the exchange rate"
        + " as the amount of foreign currency required to buy one unit"
        + " of the domestic currency.",
        default="indirect",
    )
    counter_currencies: Optional[Union[str, List[str]]] = Field(
        description="An optional list of counter currency symbols to filter for."
        + " None returns all.",
        default=None,
    )

    @field_validator("base", mode="before", check_fields=False)
    @classmethod
    def to_upper(cls, v):
        """Convert the base currency to uppercase."""
        return v.upper()

    @field_validator("counter_currencies", mode="before", check_fields=False)
    @classmethod
    def convert_string(cls, v):
        """Convert the counter currencies to an upper case string list."""
        if v is not None:
            return ",".join(v).upper() if isinstance(v, list) else v.upper()
        return None
```

</details>

It would be nice to have a list of valid choices, but each source may not have data for all currencies. Or, we could miss choices by only consulting one provider.
This can be a consideration for the data provider models to handle, and country codes for currencies are widely known ISO three-letter abbreviations.

### Standard Data

Like `QueryParams`, we don't want to attempt to define every potential future field. We want a core foundation for others to build on.
We will define three fields as mandatory, "base_currency", "counter_currency", and "last_rate". This is enough to communicate our
We will define three fields as mandatory, "base_currency", "counter_currency", and "last_rate". This is enough to communicate our
data parsing requirements for this endpoint:

- Split the six-letter symbol as two symbols.
- If the provider only returns `{"symbol": "price"}`, it will need to coerced accordingly within the `transform_data` static method of the `Fetcher` class.

<details>
<summary mdxType="summary">Code example</summary>

```python
class CurrencySnapshotsData(Data):
    """Currency Snapshots Data."""

    base_currency: str = Field(description="The base, or domestic, currency.")

    last_rate: float = Field(

        + " By default, rates are expressed as the amount of foreign currency"
        + " received from selling one unit of the base currency,"
        + " or the quantity of foreign currency required to purchase"
        + " one unit of the domestic currency."
        + " To inverse the perspective, set the 'quote_type' parameter as 'direct'.
    )
    open: Optional[float] = Field(

        default=None,
    )
    volume: Optional[int] = Field(
        description=DATA_DESCRIPTIONS.get("volume", ""), default=None
    )
    prev_close: Optional[float] = Field(
        description=DATA_DESCRIPTIONS.get("prev_close", ""),
        default=None,
    )
```

</details>

## Provider Model

### File structure

We need to create a new file for our data provider.

:::note

If we created a standard model previously, the name will be the same.

```console
~/OpenBB/openbb_platform/providers/fmp/openbb_fmp/models/currency_snapshots.py
```

:::

The first line in the file will always be a docstring, with the import statements beginning below an empty line.

```python
"""FMP Currency Snapshots Model."""

# pylint: disable=unused-argument

from datetime import datetime
from typing import Any, Dict, List, Optional

from openbb_core.provider.abstract.fetcher import Fetcher
from openbb_core.provider.standard_models.currency_snapshots import (
    CurrencySnapshotsData,
    CurrencySnapshotsQueryParams,
)
from openbb_core.provider.utils.errors import EmptyDataError
from openbb_core.provider.utils.helpers import amake_request
from pandas import DataFrame, concat
from pydantic import Field, field_validator
```

### Provider QueryParams

If we have defined a Standard Model for this provider, then our life is simplified as that base model already exists that we will inherit.

#### Iheritance

All that's added is a URL to the endpoint's documentation, and then the `__json_schema_extra__` dictionary which will allow multiple base symbols to be accepted by this provider.

```python
class FMPCurrencySnapshotsQueryParams(CurrencySnapshotsQueryParams):
    """
    FMP Currency Snapshots Query.

    Source: https://site.financialmodelingprep.com/developer/docs#exchange-prices-quote
    """

    __json_schema_extra__ = {"base": ["multiple_items_allowed"]}
```

#### One off

```python
from openbb_core.provider.abstract.query_params import QueryParams


class CongressBillsQueryParams(QueryParams):
    """Congress Bills Query Parameters."""

    __json_schema_extra__ = {
        "format": {
            "x-widget_config": {
                "exclude": True,
            },
        },
        "offset": {
            "x-widget_config": {
                "exclude": True,
            },
        },
    }

    format: Literal["json", "xml"] = Field(
        default="json", description="The data format. Value can be xml or json."
    )
    limit: int = Field(
        default=100,
        description="The number of records returned. The maximum limit is 250.",
    )
    offset: Optional[int] = Field(
        default=None, description="The starting record returned. 0 is the first record."
    )
    ...
```

### Provider Data

If we have defined a Standard Model we'll need to map the fields in the sample output data to the corresponding ones in the standard model, and then define the remaining. If there isn't a standard model, then we just need to define all the fields here.

For instance, if the sample output data from the source looks like this:

```json
[
  {
    "symbol": "AEDAUD",
    "name": "AED/AUD",
    "price": 0.40401,
    "changesPercentage": 0.3901,
    "change": 0.0016,
    "dayLow": 0.40211,
    "dayHigh": 0.40535,
    "yearHigh": 0.440948,
    "yearLow": 0.356628,
    "marketCap": null,
    "priceAvg50": 0.39494148,
    "priceAvg200": 0.40097216,
    "volume": 0,
    "avgVolume": 0,
    "exchange": "FOREX",
    "open": 0.40223,
    "previousClose": 0.40244,
    "eps": null,
    "pe": null,
    "earningsAnnouncement": null,
    "sharesOutstanding": null,
    "timestamp": 1677792573
  }
]
```

We can see that there are some fields which don't have anything to do with currencies. Those will be added here so the user still has access to them, since they aren't inherited from the standard model.

```python
class FMPCurrencySnapshotsData(CurrencySnapshotsData):
    """FMP Currency Snapshots Data."""

    __alias_dict__ = {
        "last_rate": "price",
        "high": "dayHigh",
        "low": "dayLow",
        "ma50": "priceAvg50",
        "ma200": "priceAvg200",
        "year_high": "yearHigh",
        "year_low": "yearLow",
        "prev_close": "previousClose",
        "change_percent": "changesPercentage",
        "last_rate_timestamp": "timestamp",
    }

    change: Optional[float] = Field(
        description="The change in the price from the previous close.", default=None
    )
    change_percent: Optional[float] = Field(
        description="The change in the price from the previous close, as a normalized percent.",
        default=None,
        json_schema_extra={"x-unit_measurement": "percent", "x-frontend_multiply": 100},
    )
    ma50: Optional[float] = Field(
        description="The 50-day moving average.", default=None
    )
    ma200: Optional[float] = Field(
        description="The 200-day moving average.", default=None
    )
    year_high: Optional[float] = Field(description="The 52-week high.", default=None)
    year_low: Optional[float] = Field(description="The 52-week low.", default=None)
    last_rate_timestamp: Optional[datetime] = Field(
        description="The timestamp of the last rate.", default=None
    )

    @field_validator("change_percent", mode="before", check_fields=False)
    @classmethod
    def normalize_percent(cls, v):
        """Normalize the percent."""
        return v / 100 if v is not None else None
```

A validator is setup to convert the percentage to a normalized value (1% -> 0.01).

### Provider Fetcher

The Fetcher class will always have the same general construction, in this instance we will use the `transform_data` stage to parse and filter the returned data before validating the model on output.

This is where the TET (transform-extract-transform) pattern is applied.

```python
class FMPCurrencySnapshotsFetcher(
    Fetcher[FMPCurrencySnapshotsQueryParams, List[FMPCurrencySnapshotsData]]
):
    """FMP Currency Snapshots Fetcher."""

    @staticmethod
    def transform_query(params: Dict[str, Any]) -> FMPCurrencySnapshotsQueryParams:
        """Transform the query parameters."""
        return FMPCurrencySnapshotsQueryParams(**params)

    @staticmethod
    async def aextract_data(
        query: FMPCurrencySnapshotsQueryParams,
        credentials: Optional[Dict[str, str]],
        **kwargs: Any,
    ) -> List[Dict]:
        """Extract the data from the FMP endpoint."""

        api_key = credentials.get("fmp_api_key") if credentials else ""

        url = f"https://financialmodelingprep.com/api/v3/quotes/forex?apikey={api_key}"

        return await amake_request(url, **kwargs)  # type: ignore

    @staticmethod
    def transform_data(
        query: FMPCurrencySnapshotsQueryParams,
        data: List[Dict],
        **kwargs: Any,
    ) -> List[FMPCurrencySnapshotsData]:
        """Filter by the query parameters and validate the model."""

        if not data:
            raise EmptyDataError("No data was returned from the FMP endpoint.")

        # Drop all the zombie columns FMP returns.
        df = (
            DataFrame(data)
            .dropna(how="all", axis=1)
            .drop(columns=["exchange", "avgVolume"])
        )

        new_df = DataFrame()

        # Filter for the base currencies requested and the quote_type.
        for symbol in query.base.split(","):
            temp = (
                df.query("`symbol`.str.startswith(@symbol)")
                if query.quote_type == "indirect"
                else df.query("`symbol`.str.endswith(@symbol)")
            ).rename(columns={"symbol": "base_currency", "name": "counter_currency"})
            temp["base_currency"] = symbol
            temp["counter_currency"] = (
                [d.split("/")[1] for d in temp["counter_currency"]]
                if query.quote_type == "indirect"
                else [d.split("/")[0] for d in temp["counter_currency"]]
            )
            # Filter for the counter currencies, if requested.
            if query.counter_currencies is not None:
                counter_currencies = (  # noqa: F841  # pylint: disable=unused-variable
                    query.counter_currencies
                    if isinstance(query.counter_currencies, list)
                    else query.counter_currencies.split(",")
                )
                temp = (
                    temp.query("`counter_currency`.isin(@counter_currencies)")
                    .set_index("counter_currency")
                    # Sets the counter currencies in the order they were requested.
                    .filter(items=counter_currencies, axis=0)
                    .reset_index()
                )
            # If there are no records, don't concatenate.
            if len(temp) > 0:
                # Convert the Unix timestamp to a datetime.
                temp.timestamp = temp.timestamp.apply(
                    lambda x: datetime.fromtimestamp(x)
                )
                new_df = concat([new_df, temp])
            if len(new_df) == 0:
                raise EmptyDataError(
                    "No data was found using the applied filters. Check the parameters."
                )
            # Fill and replace any NaN values with NoneType.
            new_df = new_df.fillna("N/A").replace("N/A", None)
        return [
            FMPCurrencySnapshotsData.model_validate(d)
            for d in new_df.reset_index(drop=True).to_dict(orient="records")
        ]
```

If there are functions or constants that are required for the fetcher - these are typically added in a `/utils` folder with naming `helpers.py` and `constants.py` accordingly.

```

The filters might need to be updated for the specific provider, to ensure that API key or any authorization is sent correctly, and not logged. Particularly in the cassetes that are used for the CI.

### Records

The folder `/records` will contain the recordings of the data seen when running the test.

In order to get that you will need to run:

```sh
pytest test_fmp_fetchers.py --record http --record-no-overwrite
```

This will generate a file such as:

```sh
~/OpenBB/openbb_platform/providers/fmp/tests/record/test_fmp_currency_snapshots_fetcher.yaml
```

Make sure that it doesn't contain any of your API keys or credentials.
