## Overview

The `openbb-core` package relies on a set of carefully selected Python libraries, including:

- FastAPI for building the API.
- Uvicorn as the ASGI server.
- Pandas for data manipulation and analysis.
- Pydantic for data validation and serialization using Python type annotations.
- Requests/AIOHTTP for making HTTP requests.
- WebSockets for handling WebSocket connections.

The current specifications can be found in the `pyproject.toml` [file](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/OpenBB-finance/OpenBB/refs/heads/develop/openbb_platform/core/pyproject.toml) of the GitHub repository.

:::info Deploying Custom Applications
Keeping the application as lean as possible is crucial for maintaining its performance, and to eliminate bloat. Install only the components required to get the job(s) done.
:::

With just the Core, there are no routers or endpoints. Users and developers are free to create their own combinations of extensions, tailored to suit specific requirements.

The `openbb-core` package comes with the ability to operate two, independent, interfaces.

- Python Interface
  - Python application wrapping the installed routers.
  - A build script writes static files to create the application, which includes all installed extensions.
    - Docstrings and function signatures are generated by this process.
  - Configurable, and extendable, response object handling data validation, timestamping, and more.
- REST API
  - An instance of FastAPI

The application - both Python Interface and REST API - share core logic and models. It is the product of all installed [extensions](/platform/usage/extensions/overview).

All routes are a subclass of the Router class.

### Python Interface

:::important Key Information

The build script requires write access to the site-packages folder, post-installation, for generating static assets.

When a new extension is installed, or removed, the static assets must be regenerated in order to reflect the changes.

Remote deployments utilizing the interface should invoke the `openbb-build` command line script from the shell script establishing the environment, packages, and file system.
:::

Using the import below initializes the application instance from static files generated by the build script.

```python
from openbb import obb
```

The build script is not part of the `openbb-core` package. It is in the main package (`pip install openbb`), and it can be installed without any other components.

If `openbb` is not an installed package, but `openbb-core` is:

```sh
pip install openbb --no-deps
```

To build the assets:

```python
import openbb

openbb.build()
```

Restart the Python interpreter to begin using the application with:

```python
from openbb import obb
```

Alternatively, the process above can be run from the command line shell:

```sh
openbb-build
```

The bare interface includes:

- *Deprecated* /account: This module is deprecated and will be removed in a future version.
- /user: The [`user_settings.json`](/platform/settings/environment_variables) object.
- /system: The [`system_settings.json`](/platform/settings/system_settings) object.
- /coverage: Information and metadata about the data provider extensions and their definitions (providers, commands, command_model, command_schemas, reference)

:::tip Python Settings
See [`system_settings.json`](/platform/settings/system_settings) for configuring runtime parameters.
:::

### API Interface

Items described immediately above will be included as routers by setting the [environment variable](/platform/settings/environment_variables), `OPENBB_DEV_MODE='1'`

The FastAPI instance, with all installed routers and extensions, can be imported with:

```python
from openbb_core.rest_api import app
```

Launched via Uvicorn:

```sh
uvicorn openbb_core.rest_api:app
```

:::tip API Settings
See [`system_settings.json`](/platform/settings/system_settings) for configuring runtime parameters.

    width="60%"
  />
</div>

### QueryParams Class

The QueryParams class is a standardized model for handling query input parameters. Similar to `Data`, it is a subclass of `pydantic.BaseModel`.

Behaviour described here is mostly applicable to endpoints utilizing the `ProviderInterface`.

The class is used by the `ProviderInterface` to validate, merge, and discriminate endpoint parameters shared by multiple provider extensions.

Along with `__alias_dict__`, `QueryParams` uses `__json_schema_extra__` to constrict parameter inputs, and to deterimine when more than one entry should be accepted as a list.

```python
from openbb_core.provider.abstract.query_params import QueryParams
```

<details>
<summary mdxType="summary">Example</summary>

```python
"""Some Query Model."""

from datetime import date as dateType
from typing import Optional
from warnings import warn

from openbb_core.provider.abstract.query_params import QueryParams
from pydantic import Field, field_validator


class SomeQueryParams(QueryParams):
    """Some Query Parameters."""

    __alias_dict__ = {
        "symbol": "ticker",
        "start_date": "begin",
        # "input_field": "output_alias"
    }
    __json_schema_extra__ = {
        "symbol": {"multiple_items_allowed": True, "choices": SOME_SYMBOL_LIST},
        "interval": {"multiple_items_allowed": False},  # No need to define this, it is the default behaviour.
    }

    symbol: str = Field(description="The ticker symbol.")
    interval: Literal["1d", "1w", "1m"] = Field(
        default="1d",
        description="The interval of the timeseries. Choices: ["1d", "1w", "1m"]",
    )
    start_date: Optional[dateType] = Field(
        default=None,
        description="The start date, as YYYY-MM-SS, or datetime.date object",
    )
    end_date: Optional[dateType] = Field(
        default=None,
        description="The end date, as YYYY-MM-SS, or datetime.date object",
    )

    @field_validator("symbol", mode="before", check_fields=False)
    @classmethod
    def _validate_symbol(cls, v) -> str:
        """Validate the symbol."""
        if not v:
            raise ValueError("Please enter a symbol.")
        symbol = v if isinstance(v, list) else v.upper().split(",")

        new_symbols: list = []

        for s in symbol:
            if s not in SOME_SYMBOL_LIST:
                msg = f"Invalid symbol provided {s}"
                warn(msg)
                continue
            new_symbols.append(s)

        if not new_symbols:
            raise ValueError(f"No valid symbols supplied. Choices are: {SOME_SYMBOL_LIST}")

        return ",".join(new_symbols)
```

</details>

### Data Class

The OpenBB Standardized Data Model, and is a subclass of `pydantic.BaseModel`.

This is the base class for all data returned via the `ProviderInterface`, and is used for `POST` requests to the `data` field.

```python
from openbb_core.provider.abstract.data import Data
```

Key Features:

- Dynamic field support: Dynamically handles fields that are not pre-defined in the model,
- Alias handling: Maintain compatibility with different naming conventions across various data formats.
- Datetime/string interoperability.

<details>
<summary mdxType="summary">Example</summary>

```python
# Direct instantiation
data_record = Data(name="OpenBB", value=42)

# Conversion from a dictionary
data_dict = {"name": "OpenBB", "value": 42}
data_record = Data(**data_dict)

# __alias_dict__
class SomeData(Data):
    """Some Data Model."""

    __alias_dict__ = {
        "output_field": "someWhackyInputName",
    }
    output_field: str = Field(description="My Output")

SomeData(someWhackyInputName="Some Output")
```

Output:

```sh
SomeData(output_field=Some Output)
```

</details>

Using  as a function

The `Fetcher` class imposes a standardized structure, namely:

- Transform the query: output of this method should be `QueryParams` child.
- Extract the data: output of this method can be `Any` but it's recommended to be a `dict`.
- Transform the data: output of this method should be a `List[Data]` or `Data` (or a child of it - i.e. SomeData).
- Built-in test for verifying basic operation at each stage.

#### The TET Pattern

Each `Fetcher` follows this pattern. It stands for **Transform, Extract, Transform**.

The workflow divides data collection into three, seperate, tasks.

![Diagram](https://github.com/OpenBB-finance/OpenBB/assets/48914296/ae9908be-00c0-40af-8acb-afeeb9629f2b)

```python
from openbb_core.provider.abstract.fetcher import Fetcher
```

The generic methods are meant to be overwritten with the implementation.

```python

class SomeFetcher(Fetcher[SomeQueryParams, list[SomeData]]):
    """Some Fetcher."""

    # Tell query executor if credentials are required. Can be overridden by subclasses.
    # Useful if a provider has some endpoints requiring API keys, but not all.
    require_credentials = False

    @staticmethod
    def transform_query(params: dict[str, Any]) -> SomeQueryParams:
        """Transform the params to the provider-specific query."""
        raise NotImplementedError

    @staticmethod
    async def aextract_data(query: SomeQueryParams, credentials: Optional[dict[str, str]], **kwargs: Any) -> dict:
        """Asynchronously extract the data from the provider."""
        raise NotImplementedError

    @staticmethod
    def extract_data(query: SomeQueryParams, credentials: Optional[dict[str, str]], **kwargs: Any) -> dict:
        """Extract the data from the provider."""
        raise NotImplementedError

    @staticmethod
    def transform_data(query: SomeQueryParams, data: dict, **kwargs: Any) -> list[SomeData]:
        """Transform the provider-specific data."""
        raise NotImplementedError
```

:::note Notes

- One of, `extract_data`, or, `aextract_data`, must be implemented.
- All parameters for these methods are positional and should be defined as described above.

    alt="Extensions"
    width="60%"
  />
</div>

### Routers

Router extensions are registered in the `pyproject.toml` file, and installed as a Python package.

```toml
[tool.poetry.plugins."openbb_core_extension"]
my_router = "my_router.my_router:router"
```

The `Router` class is a subclass of `fastapi.APIRouter`, helping validate and complete function signatures, ensuring that the functions registered as API endpoints have the correct parameters and return types.

```python
from openbb_core.provider.app.router import Router
```

Initialize the class with a prefix and description.

```python
some_router = Router(prefix="", description="Some description of this router.")
some_router.include_router(some_sub_router)
```

The `api_router` property provides access to the underlying APIRouter instance, allowing for direct interaction with the FastAPI routing system, if needed.

### @router.command

A `@router.command` decorator is exposed upon initialization, extending the functionality of `FastAPI().add_api_route()` to include additional parameters:

- `model`
  - A model name shared by all Provider extensions feeding the same input - i.e, "EquityHistorical"
- `examples`
  - Examples for use to include in documentation and Python docstring - see the page [here](extensions) for an explanation.
- `no_validate`
  - A flag to disable response validation for the endpoint.
    - The output type is assigned as `Any`
- All other arguments and keyword arguments are passed to `APIRouter.add_api_route` - i.e, `openapi_extra=dict(some_key=some_value)`

#### Response Model

Define the response model as part of the function's definition.

```python
@router.command(
    methods=["POST"],
    examples=[
        PythonEx(
            description="Calculate HMA with historical stock data.",
            code=[
                "stock_data = obb.equity.price.historical(symbol='TSLA', start_date='2023-01-01', provider='fmp')",
                "hma_data = obb.technical.hma(data=stock_data.results, target='close', length=50, offset=0)",
            ],
        ),
    ],
)
def hma(
    data: list[Data],
    target: str = "close",
    index: str = "date",
    length: int = 50,
    offset: int = 0,
) -> list[Data]: ...
```

### OBBject Class

The `OBBject` class is the standard response object from output functions, and has the following attributes:

- `results`: Serializable data that was returned by the command.
- `provider`: The name of the provider that was used to obtain the data, if any.
- `warnings`: Warnings generated by the command execution.
- `extra`: Additional metadata about the command run, including any arguments, the route, the timestamp, etc.

It is extendable, similar to a Pandas extension, and has methods for converting the results to different formats.

```python
from openbb_core.app.model.obbject import OBBject
```

A bare instance can be created by defining `results` as None.

```python
obbject = OBBject(results=None)
```

#### Output Conversion

Various formats and filtering can be applied to the function's output.

- `model_dump()`: Pydantic method for converting the complete object to a Python dictionary.
- `model_dump_json()`: Pydantic method for converting the complete object to a serialized JSON string.
- `to_df()`: Alias for `to_dataframe()`, and converts the contents of `obbject.results` to a Pandas DataFrame.
- `to_dict()`: Converts the contents of `obbject.results` to a Python dictionary object with a given `orientation`.
- `to_numpy()`: Convert the contents of `obbject.results` to a NumPy array.
- `to_polars()`: Converts the contents of `obbject.results` to a Polars DataFrame.

:::note
Polars is not included with OpenBB packages and must be installed.
:::

#### OBBject Extensions

An OBBject extension is created by defining `pyproject.toml` and installing the package.

```toml
[tool.poetry.plugins."openbb_obbject_extension"]
some_extension = "some_extension:ext"
```

The module's `__init__.py` file creates an instance of the extension object, and is attached to the output of every command.

```python
from openbb_core.app.model.extension import Extension

ext = Extension(name="some_extension")

@ext.obbject_accessor
class SomeExtension:
    def __init__(self, obbject):
        self._obbject = obbject

    def hello(self):
        print(f"Say Hello!")
```

An example of this type of extension is, [`openbb-charting`](https://pypi.org/project/openbb-charting/).

## Provider to Extension

  alt="Overview"
  width="100%"
/>

### ProviderInterface

The `ProviderInterface` is the map of all installed provider extensions to their respective callables, and is a Singleton accepting no initialization parameters.

It is responsible for handling the `provider` parameter - i.e, `provider="yfinance"` at execution, and is called by internal processes.

There is not a general need to interact with this class directly; however, it is useful to know that it exists.

```python
from openbb_core.app.provider_interface import ProviderInterface
```

Each item in the `ProviderInterface` maps to a `Fetcher`, which executes the TET pattern.

#### Provider Extensions

A provider extension is created by defining `pyproject.toml` and installing the package.

```toml
[tool.poetry.plugins."openbb_provider_extension"]
some_provider = "some_provider:some_provider"
```

It is a collection of data-collecting Fetchers that should be added to the application via the `provider` parameter.

### Provider Class

The `Provider` class is initialized in the `__init__.py` file of a provider extension module.

```python
from openbb_core.provider.abstract.provider import Provider
```

It maps the `Router` to the `Provider`, and defines other key metadata for the extension. The example below is from `openbb-bls`.

This is how the `ProviderInterface` maps any `@router.command(model="SomeModel")` function to all known instances.

<details>
<summary mdxType="summary">Example</summary>

```python
"""BLS Provider Module."""

from openbb_bls.models.search import BlsSearchFetcher
from openbb_bls.models.series import BlsSeriesFetcher
from openbb_core.provider.abstract.provider import Provider

bls_provider = Provider(
    name="bls",
    website="https://www.bls.gov/developers/api_signature_v2.htm",
    description="The Bureau of Labor Statistics' (BLS) Public Data Application Programming Interface (API)"
    + " gives the public access to economic data from all BLS programs."
    + " It is the Bureau's hope that talented developers and programmers will use the BLS Public Data API to create"
    + " original, inventive applications with published BLS data.",
    credentials=["api_key"],
    fetcher_dict={
        "BlsSearch": BlsSearchFetcher,
        "BlsSeries": BlsSeriesFetcher,
    },
    repr_name="Bureau of Labor Statistics' (BLS) Public Data API",
    instructions="Sign up for a free API key here: https://data.bls.gov/registrationEngine/",
)
```

</details>

### Using Fetcher Class as a function

A `Fetcher` can be executed without initialization, as an async function. It requires two positional arguments as dictionaries:

- `query` - a dictionary to be converted into the QueryParams class.
- `credentials` - a dictionary of credentials required for the provider and endpoint.
  - Pass as an empty dictionary when no credentials are required.

```python
results = await SomeFetcher.fetch_data({"symbol": "btcusd"}, {})
```

The return is the output of `SomeFetcher.tranform_data`

To implement the `ProviderInterface` as a `Router` endpoint, follow the pattern below in the extension's `router` file.

<details>
<summary mdxType="summary">Example</summary>

```python

from openbb_core.app.model.command_context import CommandContext  # A FastAPI Depends injection with the initialized user and system preferences
from openbb_core.app.model.obbject import OBBject  # The OpenBB standard response object with output validation.
from openbb_core.app.provider_interface import (
    ExtraParams, # All provider-specific parameters.
    ProviderChoices, # All providers feeding the endpoint.
    StandardParams,  # Parameters defined in the common 'Standard' model, if any.
)
from openbb_core.app.query import Query  # The query executor.
from openbb_core.app.router import Router


router = Router(prefix="", description="Some Router.")


@router.command(
    model="SomeModel",
    examples=[
        APIEx(parameters={"symbol": "btcusd", "interval": "1d", "provider": "some_provider"}),
    ],
)
async def some_function(
    cc: CommandContext,
    provider_choices: ProviderChoices,
    standard_params: StandardParams,
    extra_params: ExtraParams,
) -> OBBject:
    """Use the `SomeModel` Fetcher."""
    return await OBBject.from_query(Query(**locals()))
```

</details>
