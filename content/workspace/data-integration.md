OpenBB Workspace offers a versatile and user-friendly data connector system that allows you to integrate various data sources seamlessly. Whether you are uploading files, connecting to APIs, or integrating databases, OpenBB provides the tools you need to visualize and analyze your data effectively.

## Upload Files

Uploading files is the easiest way to import data into OpenBB Workspace. You can add one or multiple files at once, with support for formats like PDF, CSV, JSON, PNG, and JPG.

## API Endpoints

API endpoints provide a fast way to integrate custom data into OpenBB Workspace. By entering your API endpoint and required connection details, you can dynamically load and display your data.

## Custom Backend

Integrate your own backend using our example or any language-agnostic API approach. Design and implement your API, create a widgets.json file, and connect your API to OpenBB to dynamically load and display your data.

## Database Integrations

OpenBB Workspace allows you to connect directly to Snowflake, MySQL, or SQLite databases. By installing and running the OpenBB Data Connector, you can enable these integrations which allows you to run queries and analyze your data directly within OpenBB.
