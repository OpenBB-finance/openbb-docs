OpenBB's core widgets form the foundation of your financial analysis workspace. These essential components enable you to organize information, capture insights, and integrate external data sources within a unified interface, creating a powerful environment for financial analysis and decision-making.

- Create and manage multiple tabs for different analysis contexts
- Organize information into logical sections
- Separate research from analysis
- Track different market sectors
- Monitor various portfolios

- Integrated news analysis within your research workflow
