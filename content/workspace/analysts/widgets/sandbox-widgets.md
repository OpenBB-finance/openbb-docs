<HeadTitle title="Sandbox Widgets | OpenBB Workspace Docs" />

When you first log into OpenBB Workspace on [`pro.openbb.co`](https://pro.openbb.co), you'll discover a collection of pre-built widgets already available in your workspace. These demonstration widgets serve a single purpose: to showcase what OpenBB is capable of achieving as an analytical application.

#### Purpose

These out-of-the-box widgets provide immediate examples of OpenBB's analytical capabilities without requiring any setup or configuration. They demonstrate the application's potential through realistic financial data scenarios and interactive functionality, giving you an instant understanding of what's possible within the workspace environment.

#### Demonstration Value

The pre-built widgets highlight OpenBB's core strengths in financial analysis, data visualization, and workflow integration. They showcase different widget types, parameter linking capabilities, AI agent integration, and the overall user experience you can expect when building your own analytical dashboards.

#### Important Understanding

These widgets exist purely for demonstration purposes. They illustrate the application's capabilities and provide inspiration for your own analytical workflows, but they are not intended as production tools for actual financial analysis or decision-making.

The real value of OpenBB Workspace comes from connecting your own data sources, building custom widgets tailored to your specific analytical needs, and creating dashboards that reflect your unique research methodology and investment process.
