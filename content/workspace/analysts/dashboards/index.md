# Dashboards

Dashboards are the central workspace in OpenBB where you organize, visualize, and analyze financial data. They provide a flexible canvas for combining multiple widgets into comprehensive analytical views tailored to your specific needs.

## What are Dashboards?

Dashboards serve as interactive workspaces where you can:
- Arrange and organize multiple data widgets
- Create custom layouts for different analysis workflows
- Monitor real-time market data and indicators
- Share insights and collaborate with team members
- Generate static reports for documentation and presentations

## Key Features

### Flexible Layout System
Create custom layouts by dragging and dropping widgets exactly where you need them. Resize widgets to emphasize important data and create visual hierarchies that match your analytical priorities.

### Real-Time Data Updates
Dashboards automatically refresh with the latest available data, ensuring your analysis always reflects current market conditions. Configure refresh intervals to match your workflow requirements.

### Collaboration Tools
Share dashboards with team members to facilitate collaborative analysis. Recipients can view shared dashboards and create their own copies for further customization while preserving the original.

### Export Capabilities
Generate professional reports by exporting dashboards as PDF or PNG files. Include notes and annotations to capture your analytical insights alongside the data visualizations.

## Dashboard Management

Access comprehensive management options through the ellipsis menu next to each dashboard in the sidebar:

- **Rename** - Customize dashboard names for better organization
- **Move to** - Organize dashboards into folders for structured workflows
- **Duplicate** - Create copies with all widgets and settings intact
- **Open in new window** - Expand across multiple monitors
- **Share** - Collaborate with team members
- **Delete** - Remove unused dashboards
- **Export report** - Generate static PDF or PNG reports
- **Refresh data** - Update all widget data immediately

## Creating Your First Dashboard

2. Give your dashboard a descriptive name

## Best Practices

### Organization
