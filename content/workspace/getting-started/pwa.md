OpenBB Workspace is now available as a Progressive Web App (PWA), providing a seamless, native-like experience across all your devices.

Installing as a PWA offers several advantages:

- **Cross-Platform**: Consistent experience across desktop and mobile devices
- **Seamless Updates**: Automatically receives the latest features when you're online
- **Better Performance**: Cached resources provide faster load times for frequently used components
