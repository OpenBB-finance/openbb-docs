Enterprise customers receive dedicated support and professional services to maximize platform value and ensure successful implementation.

## Production Support

Enterprise support provides 8 hours daily coverage, 5 days weekly, with priority access to the support queue. Direct communication channels connect customers with technical specialists, bypassing standard routing. Priority handling ensures faster resolution of technical issues and implementation questions.

## Customer Success Partnership

Each enterprise customer receives a dedicated customer success manager for long-term platform optimization. Quarterly business reviews assess usage patterns, identify improvement opportunities, and align platform capabilities with evolving business objectives.

Success managers provide best practices consultation based on knowledge from other enterprise deployments while maintaining appropriate confidentiality. They offer strategic guidance on expanding platform adoption across teams and integrating new analytical capabilities as organizational needs grow.

## JumpStart Package

The JumpStart program delivers operational capability within weeks rather than months through structured implementation and training. This accelerated approach includes custom app development, comprehensive training, and organizational best practices establishment.

Custom app development creates a production-ready application incorporating your specific data sources, analytical workflows, and organizational requirements. The application functions both as an immediate productivity tool and a development template for future projects. Knowledge transfer ensures internal teams can maintain and extend the custom application after deployment.

Training components address different organizational roles including administrators, analysts, and specialized users. Best practices establishment covers workflow documentation, governance procedures, and platform optimization recommendations tailored to your environment.

## Professional Training Programs

Structured training programs provide role-specific education for administrators, analysts, and specialized users within your organization. Administrative training covers system configuration, user management, security implementation, and operational procedures.

Analyst training focuses on dashboard development, data analysis methodologies, collaboration workflows, and platform feature utilization. Custom workshops address specific industry requirements, advanced use cases, and organizational analytical approaches.

Training materials include comprehensive documentation, hands-on exercises, and reference resources for ongoing use. Follow-up sessions ensure knowledge retention and address implementation questions that arise during actual platform usage.

## Implementation Services

Professional implementation services include infrastructure assessment, deployment architecture design, and integration planning. The implementation team evaluates existing environments, recommends optimal configurations, and provides guidance throughout the deployment process.

Security configuration assistance ensures proper integration with authentication systems, access controls, and audit frameworks. Data integration support facilitates connections to internal systems, databases, and external sources through appropriate methods and protocols.

## Enterprise Pricing

OpenBB Enterprise uses a seat-based subscription model adapted to organizational requirements. Pricing factors include user count, deployment configuration (cloud, VPC, or on-premises), data integration complexity, and support level requirements.

Base subscriptions include software licensing, standard support, regular updates, security patches, and documentation access. Additional services including JumpStart packages, custom development, enhanced support, and specialized training require separate pricing based on project scope.
