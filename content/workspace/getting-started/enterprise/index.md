# Enterprise Overview

OpenBB Workspace Enterprise deploys within your infrastructure, ensuring data never leaves your environment. The platform operates without external dependencies while providing the same analytical capabilities as the cloud version.

## Deployment Control

Deploy on-premises within your data center for maximum control over hardware, network, and security configurations. Private cloud deployment in AWS, Azure, or GCP maintains infrastructure flexibility while keeping data within your security boundaries. Hybrid architectures combine on-premises data storage with cloud compute resources when required.

All deployment options include unlimited users, unlimited data sources, and unlimited computational resources. No artificial restrictions exist on platform usage within your environment.

## Team Operations

Multiple teams work within shared environments while maintaining separate access controls and data permissions. Shared dashboards distribute insights across departments. Real-time collaboration enables simultaneous analysis and commentary on the same datasets.

Knowledge management captures institutional analytical approaches through shared widget libraries and template repositories. Team analytics show usage patterns, popular content, and collaboration effectiveness metrics.

## Administrative Control

Configure user access through role-based permissions at application, widget, data source, and AI feature levels. Import users from existing directory services or manage them locally. Customize platform appearance with corporate branding, colors, and logos.

Monitor system performance, user activity, and resource consumption through administrative dashboards. Configure automated backups, retention policies, and maintenance schedules.
