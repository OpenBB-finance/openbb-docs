### Website and Iframe

Often, during your research workflow, you need to browse multiple websites to extract data. The Website widget is a versatile tool that lets you embed and interact with websites directly within your dashboard, making it easy to access data from various sources all within OpenBB.

Please note that some websites may disable this functionality. We will automatically check and display the website only if permitted by the site owner.
