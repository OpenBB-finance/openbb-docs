<HeadTitle title="Commands And Arguments | ODP CLI Docs" />

Commands are displayed on-screen in a lighter colour, compared with menu items, and they will not be prefaced with, `>`.

Functions have a variety of parameters that differ by endpoint and provider. The --help dialogue will provide guidance on nuances of any particular command.

The available data sources for each command are displayed on the right side of the screen, and are selected with the `--provider` argument.

## Help arguments

The `help` command shows the current menu. The screen will display all the commands and menus that exist, including a short description for each of these.

Adding `--help`, or `-h`, to any command will display the description and parameters for that particular function.

## Entering Parameters

Parameters are all defined through the same pattern, --argument, followed by a space, and then the value.

If the parameter is a boolean (true/false), there is no value to enter. Adding the --argument flags the parameter to be the opposite of its default state.

Use the auto-complete to prompt choices and reduce the amount of keystrokes required to run a complex function.

## Auto-complete

The ODP CLI is equipped with an auto completion engine that presents choices based on the current menu and command. Whenever you start typing, suggestion prompts will appear for existing commands and menus. When the command contains arguments, pressing the `space bar` after typing the command will present the list of available arguments.

This functionality dramatically reduces the number of key strokes required to perform tasks and, in many cases, eliminates the need to consult the help dialogue for reminders. Choices - where they are bound by a defined list - are scrollable with the up and down arrow keys.

## Global commands

These are commands that can be used throughout the CLI and will work regardless of the menu where they belong.

### Help

`--help`, or `-h` can be attached to any command, as described above.

### CLS

The `cls` command clears the entire CLI screen.

### Quit

The `quit` command (can also use `q` or `..`) allows to leave the current menu to go one menu above. If the user is on the root, that will mean leaving the CLI.

### Exit

The `exit` command allows the user to exit the CLI.

### Reset

The `reset` command will reset the CLI to its default state. This is specially useful for development so you can refresh the CLI without having to close and open it again.

### Results

The `results` command will display the stack of `OBBjects` that have been generated during the session, which can be later injected on the data processing commands.

## Setting The Default Source

The default data providers for each command can be defined within the user configuration file: `/home/your-user/.openbb_platform/user_settings.json`. You can set a single provider or a priority list. If a list is set, the command will use the first provider for which all required credentials set.

See the example below for `obb.equity.price.historical` command:

```json
# user_settings.json
{
    "defaults": {
        "commands": {
            "equity.price.historical": {
                "provider": "fmp"
            },
            "equity.fundamental.balance": {
                "provider": ["intrinio", "fmp", "polygon"]
            },
            ...
        }
    }
}

## Pre-Requisites

ODP CLI is a wrapper around the [OpenBB Python Package](/odp/python), and should be installed along side an existing OpenBB installation.

- A Python virtual environment with a version between 3.9 and 3.11, inclusive, is required.

Please refer to the [Python install documentation](/odp/python/installation) for instructions and more information.

:::info
If the ODP python package is not already installed, the `openbb-cli` package  will install all available components.
:::

### Windows

The machine may need to have an installation of Visual C++ Build Tools available. Download the elements highlighted in the images below.

<details>
<summary mdxType="summary">"Microsoft Visual C++ 14.0 or greater is required"</summary>

Download and install [C++ Build Tools](https://visualstudio.microsoft.com/visual-cpp-build-tools/), restart the machine, then continue.

## Toolbar

![Chart Tools](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/85772166/233247997-55c03cbd-9ca9-4f5e-b3fb-3e5a9c63b6eb.png)

The toolbar is located at the bottom of the window, and provides methods for:

- Panning and zooming.
- Modifying the title and axis labels.
- Adjusting the hover read out.
- Toggling light/dark mode.
- Annotating and drawing.
- Exporting raw data.
- Saving the chart as an image.
- Adding supplementary external data as an overlay.

The label for each tool is displayed by holding the mouse over it.

The toolbar's visibility can be toggled utilizing the `ctrl + h` shortcut.

## Text Tools

Annotate a chart by clicking on the `Add Text` button, or with the keyboard, `ctrl + t`.

![Annotate Charts](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/85772166/233248056-d459d7a0-ba2d-4533-896a-79406ded859e.png)

Enter some text, make any adjustments to the options, then `submit`.  Place the crosshairs over the desired data point and click to place the text.

![Place Text](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/85772166/233728645-74734241-4da2-4cff-af17-b68a62e95113.png)

After placement, the text can be updated or deleted by clicking on it again.

![Delete Annotation](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/85772166/233728428-55d2a8e5-a68a-4cd1-9dbf-4c1cd697187e.png)

## Change Titles

The title of the chart is edited by clicking the button, `Change Titles`, near the middle center of the toolbar, immediately to the right of the `Add Text` button.

## Draw Tools

![Edit Colors](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/85772166/233729318-8af947fa-ce2a-43e2-85ab-657e583ac8b1.png)

The fourth group of icons on the toolbar are for drawing lines and shapes.

Interactive tables open in a separate window ([PyWry](https://github.com/OpenBB-finance/pywry)). These provide methods for searching, sorting, filtering, exporting and even adapting settings directly on the table.

:::tip
All ODP CLI results are displayed in interactive tables by default, unless the interactive model is disabled from the `/settings` menu.

</details>

## Sorting

Columns can be sorted ascending/descending/unsorted, by clicking the controls to the right of each header title.  The status of the filtering is shown as a blue indicator.

![Sort Columns](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/85772166/233248754-20c18390-a7af-490c-9571-876447b1b0ae.png)

## Filtering

The settings button, at the lower-left corner, displays choices for customizing the table. By selecting the `Type` to be `Advanced`, columns become filterable.

![Table Settings](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/85772166/233248876-0d788ff4-974d-4d92-8186-56864469870a.png)

The columns can be filtered with min/max values or by letters, depending on the content of each column.

![Filtered Tables](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/85772166/233248923-45873bf1-de6b-40f8-a4aa-05e7c3d21ab0.png)

## Hiding columns

The table will scroll to the right as far as there are columns.  Columns can be removed from the table by clicking the icon to the right of the settings button and unchecking it from the list.

![Select Columns](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/85772166/233248976-849791a6-c126-437c-bb54-454ba6ea4fa2.png)

## Select rows per page

The number of rows per page is defined in the drop down selection near the center, at the bottom.

![Rows per Page](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/85772166/233249018-8269896d-72f7-4e72-a4d4-2715d1f11b96.png)

## Freeze the Index and Column Headers

Right-click on the index name to enable/disable freezing when scrolling to the right. Column headers are frozen by default.

![Index Freeze](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/85772166/234103702-0965dfbd-24ca-4a66-8c76-9fac28abcff8.png)

## Exporting Data

At the bottom-right corner of the table window, there is a button for exporting the data.  To the left, the drop down selection for `Type` can be defined as a CSV, XLSX, or PNG file.  Exporting the table as a PNG file will create a screenshot of the table at its current view, and data that is not visible will not be captured.

![Export Data](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/85772166/233249065-60728dd1-612e-4684-b196-892f3604c0f4.png)

<HeadTitle title="OpenBBUserData Folder | ODP CLI Docs" />

The OpenBBUserData folder is where exports, routines, and other user-related content is saved and stored.

:::info
If a new file is placed in the folder (like a Routine) the CLI will need to be reset before auto complete will recognize it.
:::

## Default Location

Its default location is the home of the system user account, similar to the following paths:
- macOS: `Macintosh HD/Users/<YOUR_USERNAME>/OpenBBUserData`
- Windows: `C:/Users/<YOUR_USERNAME>/OpenBBUserData`

This folder contains all things user-created. For example:

- Exported files
- Styles and themes
- Routines
- Logs

:::note
**Note:** With a WSL-enabled Windows installation, this folder will be under the Linux partition
:::

## Update Folder Location

The location of this folder can be set by the user by changing the user configuration file: `/home/your-user/.openbb_platform/user_settings.json`.

```json
{
...
"preferences": {
    "data_directory": "/path/to/NewOpenBBUserData",
    "export_directory": "/path/to/NewOpenBBUserData"
},
...
}
```

<HeadTitle title="Quick Start - Usage | ODP CLI Docs" />

## Launch

- Configure any data provider credentials in the [`user_settings.json`](/odp/python/settings/user_settings/api_keys) file.
- Open a Terminal and activate the environment where the `openbb-cli` package was installed.
- On the command line, enter: `openbb`

![CLI Home](https://github.com/OpenBB-finance/OpenBBTerminal/assets/85772166/d1617c3b-c83d-4491-a7bc-986321fd7230)

## Menus

:::info
Menus are distinguishable from commands by the character, `>`, on the left of the screen.
:::

Enter a menu by typing it out and pressing return.

```console
economy
```

![Economy Menu](https://github.com/OpenBB-finance/OpenBBTerminal/assets/85772166/b68491fc-d6c3-42a7-80db-bfe2aa848a5a)

### Go Back One Level

Return to the parent menu by entering either:

- `..`
- `q`

### Go Back To Home

Return to the base menu by entering either:

- `/`
- `home`

### Jump Between Menus

Use absolute paths to navigate from anywhere, to anywhere.

From:

```console
/equity/calendar/earnings
```

To:

```console
/economy/calendar
```

## Commands

Commands are displayed on-screen in a lighter colour, compared with menu items, and they will not have, `>`.

Functions have a variety of parameters that differ by endpoint and provider. Use the `--help` dialogue to understand the nuances of any particular command.

### How To Enter Parameters

Parameters are all defined through the same pattern, `--argument`, followed by a space, and then the value.

If the parameter is a boolean (true/false), there is no value to enter. Adding the `--argument` flags the parameter to be the opposite of its default state.

:::danger
The use of positional arguments is not supported.

❌ `historical AAPL --start_date 2024-01-01`

✅ `historical --symbol AAPL --start_date 2024-01-01`
:::

### Use Auto Complete

The auto completion engine is triggered when the spacebar is pressed following any command, or parameter with a defined set of choices.

After the first parameter has been set, remaining parameters will be triggered by entering `--`.

```console
historical --symbol AAPL --start_date 2024-01-01 --
```

![Auto Complete](https://github.com/OpenBB-finance/OpenBBTerminal/assets/85772166/78e68bbd-094e-4558-bce0-92b8d556fcaf)

### Data Processing Commands

Data processing extensions, like `openbb-technical` accept `--data` as an input.

:::info
Command outputs are cached. These can be check using the `results` command and are selected with the `--data` parameter.
:::

```console
# Store the command output
/equity/price/historical --symbol SPY --start_date 2024-01-01 --provider yfinance

# Check results content
results

# Use the results
/technical/rsi --data OBB0 --chart
```

## Help Dialogues

Display the help dialogue by attaching, `--help` or `-h`, to any command.

:::info
Use this to identify the providers compatible with each parameter, if applicable.
:::

```console
calendar --help
```

```console
usage: calendar [--start_date START_DATE] [--end_date END_DATE] [--provider {fmp,nasdaq,tradingeconomics}] [--country COUNTRY] [--importance {Low,Medium,High}]
                [--group {interest rate,inflation,bonds,consumer,gdp,government,housing,labour,markets,money,prices,trade,business}] [-h] [--export EXPORT]
                [--sheet-name SHEET_NAME [SHEET_NAME ...]]

Get the upcoming, or historical, economic calendar of global events.

options:
  --start_date START_DATE
                        Start date of the data, in YYYY-MM-DD format.
  --end_date END_DATE   End date of the data, in YYYY-MM-DD format.
  --provider {fmp,nasdaq,tradingeconomics}
                        The provider to use for the query, by default None.
                            If None, the provider specified in defaults is selected or 'fmp' if there is
                            no default.
  --country COUNTRY     Country of the event. (provider: nasdaq, tradingeconomics)
  -h, --help            show this help message
  --export EXPORT       Export raw data into csv, json, xlsx and figure into png or jpg
  --sheet-name SHEET_NAME [SHEET_NAME ...]
                        Name of excel sheet to save data to. Only valid for .xlsx files.

tradingeconomics:
  --importance {Low,Medium,High}
                        Importance of the event.
  --group {interest rate,inflation,bonds,consumer,gdp,government,housing,labour,markets,money,prices,trade,business}
                        Grouping of events

```

If the source selected was Nasdaq, `--provider nasdaq`, the `--importance` and `--group` parameters will be ignored.

```console
/economy/calendar --provider nasdaq --country united_states
```

| date                | country       | event                    | actual   | previous   | consensus   | description   |

| cont... | | | | | | |

## Export Data

Data can be exported as a CSV, JSON, or XLSX file, and can also be exported directly from the interactive tables and charts.

### Named File

This command exports the Nasdaq directory as a specific CSV file. The path to the file is displayed on-screen.

```console
/equity/search --provider nasdaq --export nasdaq_directory.csv
```

```console
Saved file: /Users/myusername/OpenBBUserData/nasdaq_directory.csv
```

### Unnamed File

If only supplied with the file type, the export will be given a generic name beginning with the date and time.

```console
/equity/search --provider nasdaq --export csv
```

```
Saved file: /Users/myusername/OpenBBUserData/20240508_145308_controllers_search.csv
```

### Specify Sheet Name

Exports can share the same `.xlsx` file by providing a `--sheet-name`.

```console
/equity/search --provider nasdaq --export directory.xlsx --sheet-name nasdaq
```

## Run Multiple Commands

A chain of commands can be run from a single line, separate each process with `/`. The example below will draw two charts and can be pasted as a single line.

```console
/equity/price/historical --symbol AAPL,MSFT,GOOGL,AMZN,META,NVDA,NFLX,TSLA,QQQ --start_date 2022-01-01 --provider yfinance --chart/performance --symbol AAPL,MSFT,GOOGL,AMZN,META,NVDA,NFLX,TSLA,QQQ --provider finviz --chart
```

## Example Routine

To demonstrate how multiple commands are sequenced as a script, try running the example Routine.

```console
/exe --example
```

import HeadTitle from '@site/src/components/General/HeadTitle.tsx';

<HeadTitle title="Advanced Routines - Routines | ODP CLI Docs" />

## Input Variables

Arguments are variables referenced within the `.openbb` script as `$ARGV` or `$ARGV[0]`, `$ARGV[1]`, and so on. They are provided in the CLI when running `exe` by adding the `--input` flag, followed by the variables separated by commas.

### Example

```text
# This script requires you to use arguments. This can be done with the following:
# exe --file routines_template_with_input.openbb -i TSLA
# Replace the name of the file with your file.

# Navigate to the menu
/equity/price

# Load the data and display a chart
historical --symbol $ARGV --chart
```

## Set Variables

In addition to external variables using the keyword, `ARGV`, internal variables can be defined with the, `$`, character.

Note that the variable can have a single element or can be constituted by an array where elements are separated using a comma “,”.

### Internal Variables Example

```text
# Example routine with internal variables.

$TICKERS = XLE,XOP,XLB,XLI,XLP,XLY,XHE,XLV,XLF,KRE,XLK,XLC,XLU,XLRE

/equity

price

historical --symbol $TICKERS --provider yfinance --start_date 2024-01-01 --chart

home
```

## Relative Time Keyword Variables

In addition to the powerful variables discussed earlier, OpenBB also supports the usage of relative keywords, particularly for working with dates. These relative keywords provide flexibility when specifying dates about the current day. There are four types of relative keywords:

1. **AGO**: Denotes a time in the past relative to the present day. Valid examples include `$365DAYSAGO`, `$12MONTHSAGO`, `$1YEARSAGO`.

2. **FROMNOW**: Denotes a time in the future relative to the present day. Valid examples include `$365DAYSFROMNOW`, `$12MONTHSFROMNOW`, `$1YEARSFROMNOW`.

3. **LAST**: Refers to the last specific day of the week or month that has occurred. Valid examples include `$LASTMONDAY`, `$LASTJUNE`.

4. **NEXT**: Refers to the next specific day of the week or month that will occur. Valid examples include `$NEXTFRIDAY`, `$NEXTNOVEMBER`.

The result will be a date with the conventional date associated with OpenBB, i.e. `YYYY-MM-DD`.

### Relative Time Example

```text
$TICKERS = XLE,XOP,XLB,XLI,XLP,XLY,XHE,XLV,XLF,KRE,XLK,XLC,XLU,XLRE

/equity

price

historical --symbol $TICKERS --provider yfinance --start_date $3MONTHSAGO --chart

..

calendar

earnings --start_date $NEXTMONDAY --end_date $NEXTFRIDAY --provider nasdaq

home
```

## Foreach Loop

Finally, what scripting language would this be if there were no loops? For this, we were inspired by MatLab. The loops in OpenBB utilize the foreach and end convention, allowing for iteration through a list of variables or arguments to execute a sequence of commands.

To create a foreach loop, you need to follow these steps:

1. Create the loop header using the syntax: `foreach $$VAR in X` where `X` represents either an argument or a list of variables. It's worth noting that you can choose alternative names for the `$$VAR` variable, as long as the `$$` convention is maintained.

2. Insert the commands you wish to repeat on the subsequent lines.

3. Conclude the loop with the keyword `end`.

### Loop Example

```text
# Iterates through ARGV elements.
foreach $$VAR in $ARGV[1:]
    /equity/fundamental/filings --symbol $$VAR --provider sec
end
```

<HeadTitle title="Introduction to Routines - Routines | ODP CLI Docs" />

## Overview

OpenBB Routines allows users to capture and write simple scripts for automating processes and repetitive tasks. In essence, these are text plain-text files that can be created or modified in any basic text editor with the only difference being the `.openbb` extension.

Other software like STATA, SPSS, and R-Studio share similar functionality in the area of Econometrics and the OpenBB routine scripts venture into the area of financial analysis and data collection to speed up the process.

Routines make it easy to automate a series of processes, and this includes mining and dumping large amounts of data to organized spreadsheets.  Making use of `--export` and `--sheet-name`, data collection is more efficient and reliable, with results that are easily replicable.

## Pipeline of Commands

One of the main objectives of the ODP CLI is to automate a user's investment research workflow - not just a single command, but the complete process.  This is where the pipeline of commands comes in,  running a sequence of commands.

An example of a pipeline of commands is:

```console
/equity/price/historical --symbol AAPL/../../technical/ema --data OBB0 --length 50
```

Which will perform a exponential moving average (`ema`) on the historical price of Apple (`AAPL`).

### Step-by-Step Explanation

This will do the following:

1. `equity` - Go into `equity` menu.

2. `price` - Go into `price` sub-menu.

3. `historical --symbol AAPL` - Load historical price data for Apple.

4. `..` (X2) will walk back to the root menu.

5. `technical` -  Go into Technical Analysis (`technical`) menu.

6. `ema --data OBB0 --length 50` - Run the exponential moving average indicator with windows of length 50 (`--length 50`) on the last cached result (`--data OBB0`)

## Routine execution

Run a routine file from the main menu, with the `exe` command. Try, `exe --example`, to get a sense of what this functionality does. Below, the `--help` dialogue is displayed.

```console
/exe -h
```

```console
usage: exe [--file FILE [FILE ...]] [-i ROUTINE_ARGS] [-e] [--url URL] [-h]

Execute automated routine script. For an example, please use `exe --example` and for documentation and to learn how create your own script type `about exe`.

optional arguments:
  --file FILE [FILE ...], -f FILE [FILE ...]
                        The path or .openbb file to run. (default: None)
  -i ROUTINE_ARGS, --input ROUTINE_ARGS
                        Select multiple inputs to be replaced in the routine and separated by commas. E.g. GME,AMC,BTC-USD (default: None)
  -e, --example         Run an example script to understand how routines can be used. (default: False)
  --url URL             URL to run openbb script from. (default: None)
  -h, --help            show this help message (default: False)

For more information and examples, use 'about exe' to access the related guide.
```

## Basic Script

The most basic script style contains 2 main elements:

- **Comments**: any text after a hashtag (`#`) is referred to as a comment. This is used to explain what is happening within the line below and is ignored when the file is executed.
- **Commands**: any text *without* a hashtag is being run inside the CLI as if the user had prompted that line in the terminal. Note that this means that you are able to create a pipeline of commands in a single line, i.e. `equity/price/historical --symbol AAPL --provider fmp` is a valid line for the script.

For instance, the text below corresponds to the example file that OpenBB provides.

```console
# Navigate into the price sub-menu of the equity module.
equity/price

# Load a company ticker, e.g. Apple
historical --symbol AAPL --provider yfinance

# Show a candle chart with a 20 day Moving Average
/technical/ema --data OBB0 --length 20

# Switch over to the Fundamental Analysis menu
/equity/fundamental

# Show balance sheet
balance --symbol aapl --provider yfinance

# Show cash flow statement
cash --symbol aapl --provider yfinance

# Show income statement
income --symbol aapl --provider yfinance

# Return to home
home
```

## Getting started

As a starting point, let's use the example above.

1. Create a new text file with the name `routines_template.openbb` and copy and paste the routine above.

2. Move the file inside the `routines` folder within the [OpenBBUserData](/odp/cli/openbbuserdata) folder and, optionally, adjust the name to your liking.

3. Open up the CLI, and type `exe --file routines_template`.  If you changed the name of the file, then replace, `routines_template`, with that.  As long as the file remains in the `~/OpenBBUserData/routines` folder, the CLI's auto-completer will provide it as a choice.

import HeadTitle from '@site/src/components/General/HeadTitle.tsx';

<HeadTitle title="Routine Macro Recorder - Routines - Usage | ODP CLI Docs" />

OpenBB script routines can be captured with the macro recorder, controlled with global commands. Enter, `record`, to start saving commands, and then, `stop`, terminates the recording. This means that any command you run will be captured in the script; and on `stop`, it will be saved to the `~/OpenBBUserData/routines/` folder.

For example:

```console
record -n sample

/equity/price/historical --symbol SPY --provider cboe --interval 1m/home/derivatives/options/chains --symbol SPY --provider cboe/home/stop/r
```

The final command after `stop`, `r`, resets the CLI so that the routine is presented as a choice in the `exe` command.

It can now be played back by entering:

```console
/exe --file sample.openbb
```

:::tip
The routine can be edited to replace parameter values with input variables - e.g, `$ARGV[0]`, `$ARGV[1]`, etc.

<HeadTitle title="Structure and Navigation | ODP CLI Docs" />

## Structure

The ODP CLI is a Command Line Interface (CLI) application. Functions (commands) are called through the keyboard with results returned as charts, tables, or text.  Charts and tables (if enabled) are displayed in a new window, and are fully interactive, while text prints directly to the Terminal screen.

A menu is a collection of commands (and sub-menus). A menu can be distinguished from a command because the former has a `>` on the left. The color of a command and a menu also differ.

## Navigation

Navigating through the CLI menus is similar to traversing folders from any operating system's command line prompt. The `/home` screen is the main directory where everything begins, and the menus are paths branched from the main. Instead of `C:\Users\OpenBB\Documents`, you'll have something like `/equity/price`. Instead of `cd ..`, you can do `..` to return the menu right above. To go back to the root menu you can do `/`.

### Absolute Paths

Absolute paths are also valid to-and-from any point. From the `/equity/price` menu, you can go directly to `crypto` menu with: `/crypto`. Note the forward slash at the start to denote the "absolute" path.

### Home

Return to the Home screen from anywhere by entering any of the following:

- `/`
- `home`
