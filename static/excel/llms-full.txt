import HeadTitle from '@site/src/components/General/HeadTitle.tsx';

<HeadTitle title="Context Management | OpenBB Workspace Docs" />

The Copilot employs a sophisticated context understanding system that prioritizes and processes multiple information sources simultaneously.

This hierarchical approach ensures that the most relevant and specific data takes precedence when generating responses, while still maintaining awareness of broader workspace context and conversation history.

## Priority

The agent prioritizes context in the following order:

| Priority | Context Type | Description |
|---|---|---|
| 1 | Explicit | Widgets added to context specifically. |
| 2 | Attached files | Files uploaded directly to the Copilot |
| 3 | Dashboard | All widgets currently on your dashboard (in all tabs). |
| 4 | Global | All widgets available within the OpenBB Workspace. |
| 5 | Conversation | The history of your current conversation. |

## Explicit context

Explicit context represents the highest priority information source, allowing you to precisely direct the Copilot's attention to specific datasets or widgets. This mechanism is particularly powerful for ensuring accuracy when working with multiple similar datasets or when you need analysis focused on a specific dataset.

When you click on the "Add to context" button on any widget you're creating a direct reference that the Copilot will prioritize above all other available information. After sending the prompt, that widget will remain in context.

<div
  style={{ display: "flex", justifyContent: "center", alignItems: "center" }}
>
  <img
    src="https://openbb-cms.directus.app/assets/24947294-2053-4efc-a68b-7ec90bf9875c.png"
    width="100%"
  />
</div>

When you use the "@" symbol followed by a widget name and the prompt is sent, the widget will disappear from context. This is meant to be a quick tag reference.

<div
  style={{ display: "flex", justifyContent: "center", alignItems: "center" }}
>
  <img
    src="https://openbb-cms.directus.app/assets/3ed47f6f-52f2-4515-b401-16bc8d6a971a.png"
    width="60%"
  />
</div>

## Dashboard

The dashboard context provides the Copilot with comprehensive awareness of your currently active dashboard. All widgets on your active dashboard become automatically available as data sources, allowing the Copilot to understand the broader context of your work session. It also has access to the widgets metadata and the current parameters selected.

<div
  style={{ display: "flex", justifyContent: "center", alignItems: "center" }}
>
  <img
    src="https://openbb-cms.directus.app/assets/2fc343e5-6eb2-4ef6-ba10-f687868bdff4.png"
    width="100%"
  />
</div>

## Attached Files

The attachment system enables the Copilot to process documents and datasets that aren't part of your current workspace widgets. Supported file types include PDF, Excel, CSV, and various other document formats.

The Copilot automatically extracts and indexes content from attached files, making them searchable and referenceable throughout your conversation. This capability is essential for performing ad-hoc analysis or incorporating external datasets and documents into your workflow.

Please note that for PDF files, text must be selectable as Optical Character Recognition (OCR) is not supported. However, you can integrate your own agent that performs OCR.

<div
  style={{ display: "flex", justifyContent: "center", alignItems: "center" }}

  <img
    src="https://openbb-cms.directus.app/assets/f3a3ab07-4ecf-4b76-af74-cd2bb1f4b3b2.png"
    width="60%"
  />
</div>

## Global Retrieval

The global retrieval system provides the Copilot with access to the entire OpenBB Workspace widget library, extending far beyond your current dashboard widgets.

When your current dashboard doesn't contain the specific data or analysis tool needed to answer a query, the Copilot can automatically identify and utilize the appropriate widgets from the entire widget library, effectively expanding your analytical capabilities on-demand without manual widget selection.

This is only possible due to the metadata associated with each widget and is why it's important to invest time in specifying the metadata carefully.

<div
  style={{ display: "flex", justifyContent: "center", alignItems: "center" }}
>
  <img
    src="https://openbb-cms.directus.app/assets/f5661493-50ec-45c0-931a-8abd70d3bc9a.png"
    width="60%"
  />
</div>

## Web Search

The web search capability enables the Copilot to access real-time information from across the internet when:

- The available workspace data is insufficient to fully answer your query.
- The user asks to look for the information on the web.

This feature automatically activates as a fallback mechanism, ensuring comprehensive responses even when dealing with breaking news, recent market developments, or information not available in your current workspace widgets.

<div
  style={{ display: "flex", justifyContent: "center", alignItems: "center" }}

    width="100%"
  />
</div>

## Conversation

Conversational context enables natural, iterative analysis by maintaining awareness of your entire dialogue history within the current session.

The Copilot tracks your explicit questions and its responses. This memory allows for follow-up queries, refinement of analysis parameters, and building upon previous insights without needing to re-establish context.

The system understands references to "the previous chart", "that analysis", or "the data we discussed" and can seamlessly continue complex analytical workflows across multiple conversation turns.

<div style={{display: 'flex', justifyContent: 'center'}}>
  <img className="pro-border-gradient" width="800" alt="Dashboard Sharing Interface" src="https://openbb-web-assets.s3.amazonaws.com/docs/launch_oct_24/sharing_dashboard.png" />
</div>

## Role-Based Access Control (RBAC)

Our enterprise-grade RBAC system provides granular control over user permissions. Instead of managing individual permissions, you can create roles that define specific access levels for different user groups.

### Creating and Managing Roles

To set up role-based access:

1. Create a new role with a descriptive name
2. Provide a clear description of the role's purpose
3. Assign users to the role

<div style={{display: 'flex', justifyContent: 'center'}}>
  <img className="pro-border-gradient" width="800" alt="Role Creation Interface" src="https://openbb-web-assets.s3.amazonaws.com/docs/onprem-mar-25/create-role-empty.png" />
</div>

<div style={{display: 'flex', justifyContent: 'center'}}>
  <img className="pro-border-gradient" width="800" alt="Role Creation Form" src="https://openbb-web-assets.s3.amazonaws.com/docs/onprem-mar-25/create-role-popup.png" />
</div>

> **Note**: You can only assign users who have already been added to the Workspace. See the User Management section for adding new users.

After creating a role, you can view all assigned users and role metadata in the Roles tab:

<div style={{display: 'flex', justifyContent: 'center'}}>
  <img className="pro-border-gradient" width="800" alt="Role User List" src="https://openbb-web-assets.s3.amazonaws.com/docs/onprem-mar-25/create-role-user-list.png" />
</div>

### Permission Management

Permissions are organized into three key categories:

1. **Apps**: Manage dashboard access through apps
2. **Widgets**: Granular control over widget access
3. **Prompts**: Control access to AI prompts

<div style={{display: 'flex', justifyContent: 'center'}}>
  <img className="pro-border-gradient" width="800" alt="Permissions Overview" src="https://openbb-assets.s3.us-east-1.amazonaws.com/docs/pro/role+permissions.png" />
</div>

#### App Permissions

To set up app permissions:

1. Configure your data integration in the App tab
2. Click the information toast message to access the Permissions section
3. Update data connection permissions from "No Access" to "Access"
4. (Optional) Grant access to specific widgets associated with the data integration instead of the entire app

<div style={{display: 'flex', justifyContent: 'center'}}>
  <img className="pro-border-gradient" width="600" alt="Backend Setup Notification" src="https://openbb-assets.s3.us-east-1.amazonaws.com/docs/pro/new-apps.png" />
</div>

<div style={{display: 'flex', justifyContent: 'center'}}>
  <img className="pro-border-gradient" width="600" alt="Permission Edit Interface" src="https://openbb-assets.s3.us-east-1.amazonaws.com/docs/pro/app2.png" />
</div>

**Efficient Permission Assignment:**

- Search by category or data provider
- Use multi-select for bulk permission assignment
- Widgets with "No Access" remain hidden from users with that role

#### Widget Permissions

If you want to grant access to specific widgets instead of the entire app, you can do so by setting widget permissions.

<div style={{display: 'flex', justifyContent: 'center'}}>
  <img className="pro-border-gradient" width="600" alt="Permission Edit Interface" src="https://openbb-assets.s3.us-east-1.amazonaws.com/docs/pro/widgets+permissions.png" />
</div>

#### Prompt Permissions

Manage access to prompts through:

1. Custom backend configuration
2. Manual setup within the Workspace
3. Role Management in the Admin Portal

<div style={{display: 'flex', justifyContent: 'center'}}>
  <img className="pro-border-gradient" width="600" alt="Prompt Setup Interface" src="https://openbb-assets.s3.us-east-1.amazonaws.com/docs/pro/prompts.png" />
</div>

<div style={{display: 'flex', justifyContent: 'center'}}>
  <img className="pro-border-gradient" width="600" alt="Prompt Sharing Controls" src="https://openbb-assets.s3.us-east-1.amazonaws.com/docs/pro/prompts-permissions.png" />
</div>

### Activity Logging

<HeadTitle title="FAQs | OpenBB Workspace Docs" />

### General

**Q: What is the purpose of a custom backend in OpenBB Workspace?**

A: A custom backend allows you to integrate your own data sources into OpenBB Workspace, enabling the creation of personalized widgets, dashboards, and templates that display your data in various ways. For more details, see the [Overview](/workspace/data-integration#1-create-the-api-server) section.

**Q: What technologies are required to set up a custom backend?**

A: You will need to use an API framework and a `widgets.json` file to define widget configurations. Optionally, you can use a `apps.json` file for layout configurations. Refer to the [Creating your own custom backend](/workspace/data-widgets) section for more information.

### Setup and Configuration

**Q: How do I start setting up a custom backend?**

A: Follow the structure outlined in the [Overview](/workspace/data-integration#getting-started-hello-world-example) section.

**Q: What is the `widgets.json` file, and why is it important?**

A: The `widgets.json` file is a configuration file that connects your custom backend data to the widgets displayed in OpenBB Workspace. It defines widget properties such as name, description, category, endpoint, and more. See the [Example Widgets Configuration](/workspace/widgets-json-reference#example-widgets-json) section for details.

**Q: How do I add Authorization to my custom backend?**

A: We provide an the ability when adding a custom backend to pass a custom Header or Query Parameter to your backend on every request. You can then verify this in your backend and either allow or deny access to the request.

<details>
<summary mdxType="summary">Authorization</summary>

<div style={{display: 'flex', justifyContent: 'left'}}>
  <img className="pro-border-gradient" width="600" alt="folder" src="https://openbb-assets.s3.us-east-1.amazonaws.com/docs/pro/authorization.png" />
</div>
</details>

### Widgets and Templates

**Q: How can I create a new widget?**

A: Define the widget in the `widgets.json` file with necessary properties like name, description, category, and endpoint. Then, create an endpoint in your FastAPI application to serve the data for this widget. Check the [Widgets json reference](/workspace/widgets-json-reference) page for guidance.

**Q: Can I customize the appearance of widgets?**

A: Yes, you can customize widget appearance using properties in the `widgets.json` file, such as `gridData` for size and `columnsDefs` for table widgets. More information is available in the [Customizing Widgets](/workspace/widgets-json-reference) section.

**Q: What are apps, and how do I use them?**

A: Apps allow you to build tailored solutions for your specific needs. In the `apps.json` file, you can specify the list of data widgets, prompts and AI agents that make up your app and serve them via an API endpoint. See the [Apps](/workspace/apps) section for more details.

**Q: How do I implement dynamic dropdown options in widgets?**

A: Use the `type: "endpoint"` in your parameter configuration and specify an `optionsEndpoint` that returns the available options. See the [Input Parameters](/workspace/widget-parameters/advanced-dropdown) page for implementation details.

**Q: Can I group widgets to share parameters?**

A: Yes, widgets can be grouped by using the same parameter configuration. This allows a single parameter selection to update all related widgets. More information is available in the [Parameter Grouping](/workspace/widget-parameters/parameter-grouping) page.

### Troubleshooting

**Q: I can't connect to my backend using Safari/Brave. What should I do?**

A: Ensure your API is running over HTTPS. You may need to create a self-signed certificate and configure your browser to trust it.

<details>
<summary mdxType="summary">Safari/Brave HTTPS Setup</summary>

OpenBB Platform API Over HTTPS

To run the API over the HTTPS protocol, you must first create a self-signed certificate and the associated key. After steps 1 & 2 above, you can generate the files by entering this to the command line:

```sh
openssl req -x509 -days 3650 -out localhost.crt -keyout localhost.key   -newkey rsa:4096 -nodes -sha256   -subj '/CN=localhost' -extensions EXT -config <( \
   printf "[dn]\nCN=localhost\n[req]\ndistinguished_name = dn\n[EXT]\nsubjectAltName=DNS:localhost\nkeyUsage=digitalSignature\nextendedKeyUsage=serverAuth")
```

Two files will be created, in the current working directory, that are passed as keyword arguments to the `openbb-api` entry point.

```sh
openbb-api --ssl_keyfile localhost.key --ssl_certfile localhost.crt
```

**Note**: Adjust the command to include the full path to the file if the current working directory is not where they are located.

The certificate - `localhost.crt` - will need to be added to system's trust store. The process for this will depend on the operating system and the user account privilege.

A quick solution is to visit the server's URL, show the details of the warning, and choose to continue anyways.

Contact the system administrator if you are using a work device and require additional permissions to complete the configuration.

![This Connection Is Not Private](https://in.norton.com/content/dam/blogs/images/norton/am/this_connection_not_is_private.png)

</details>

**Q: My widget data is not refreshing as expected. What could be wrong?**

A: Check the `refetchInterval` and `staleTime` settings in your `widgets.json` file. Ensure they are set appropriately for your data's update frequency. Refer to the [Refetch Interval](/workspace/widget-configuration/refetch-interval) section for more information. Or you have set the [`runButton`](/workspace/widget-configuration/run-button) to `true` in the `widgets.json` file which doesn't refresh the data until you click on it.

<HeadTitle title="OpenBB Add-in for Excel Docs" />

The OpenBB Add-in for Excel enables enterprise users to access all available data from their OpenBB Workspace through interactive widgets.

## OpenBB Widgets

Enterprise users with access to the OpenBB Add-in for Excel can utilize the **Excel formula** option in their widget settings to access widget data directly in Excel.

<center>
<img src="https://openbb-cms.directus.app/assets/cf39abef-9a93-42fa-b98f-d1e7a2e38c77.png" alt="Excel formula dropdown in widget settings" width="900px" />
</center>

### Dynamic Widgets with Implicit Parameters

When accessing the **Excel formula** dropdown, users will see the following interface:

<center>
<img src="https://openbb-cms.directus.app/assets/fd7f2baf-edd3-48b9-a3d8-6bc3f33c0c68.png" alt="Excel formula interface" width="900px" />
</center>

The interface displays the widget name, backend information, and the corresponding Excel formula. For example:

```excel
=OBB.WIDGET("DTCC Trades","swap_rate_levels_custom_obb",{"currency","USD";"swap_type","OIS";"period","1y"})
```

Note: The formula is displayed with indentation for better readability, but when copied to the clipboard, it will be formatted as a single line for Excel compatibility.

Here's how it appears in Excel:

</center>

### Dynamic Widgets with Explicit Parameters

Users can enable an alternative mode by selecting the "with explicit parameters" checkbox. This mode separates the parameters from the formula, creating a more flexible widget-like experience in Excel.

<center>
<img src="https://openbb-cms.directus.app/assets/22ce67c6-efec-4021-886d-0452891a2af9.png" alt="Explicit parameters interface" width="900px" />
</center>

Implementation example:

</center>

Note: The formula and parameters are initially set to cell A1, but users can modify the formula parameters to reference different cell ranges based on their specific needs.

## Dashboard to Excel Export

Users can export entire dashboard data to Excel using the left sidebar export functionality.

<center>
<img src="https://openbb-cms.directus.app/assets/6bf99ebf-7c9e-4a3a-b83b-ee5b466ffd9c.png" alt="Dashboard export options" width="400px" />
</center>

Three export options are available:

</center>

This includes:
- Widget metadata
- Parameter configurations
- Dashboard name
- Export timestamp

### Static Data Export

When exporting in static data mode, a progress dialog appears to indicate the export status:

<!-- markdownlint-disable MD033 -->
import HeadTitle from '@site/src/components/General/HeadTitle.tsx';

<HeadTitle title="OBB.GET | OpenBB Add-in for Excel Docs" />

The `OBB.GET` function is a powerful data extraction tool that allows you to precisely slice and extract specific portions of data from any array or range in Excel. It's particularly useful when working with data returned by other OpenBB functions, enabling you to focus on exactly the information you need.

## Key Features

- Extract specific rows, columns, or both from any data range
- Use either labels (like dates or column names) or numeric indices
- Support for single values, ranges, and arrays
- Negative indexing for accessing data from the end
- Flexible input formats for dates and text

## Syntax

```excel
=OBB.GET(array, [rows], [columns])
```

### Parameters

| Parameter | Type | Description | Required | Examples |
|-----------|------|-------------|----------|----------|
| array | Any | The source data range to slice. This can be any array, including results from other OBB functions. | Yes | `A1:D3`, `OBB.WIDGET(...)` |
| rows | Any | Row selection using labels or indices. Can be a single value, range, or array. | No | `"2023/09/30"`, `2`, `{1,3}`, `-1` |
| columns | Any | Column selection using labels or indices. Can be a single value, range, or array. | No | `"revenue"`, `3`, `{"A","C"}` |

### Return Value

Returns a subset of the input array based on the specified row and column selections. The return type matches the input data type.

## Examples

Suppose you have the following financial data in cells A1:D3:

| period_ending | revenue            | cost_of_revenue    | gross_profit       |
|---------------|--------------------|--------------------|--------------------|
| 2023/09/30    | 383 285 000 000.00 | 214 137 000 000.00 | 169 148 000 000.00 |
| 2022/09/24    | 394 328 000 000.00 | 223 546 000 000.00 | 170 782 000 000.00 |
| 2021/09/25    | 365 817 000 000.00 | 212 981 000 000.00 | 152 836 000 000.00 |

### Common Use Cases

1. **Get a Single Row by Date**

```excel
=OBB.GET(A1:D3, "2023/09/30")
```

Returns the entire row for September 30, 2023.

2. **Get a Single Column by Name**

```excel
=OBB.GET(A1:D3, , "revenue")
```

Returns all revenue values.

3. **Get a Single Cell by Index**

```excel
=OBB.GET(A1:D3, 2, 3)
```

Returns the value at row 2, column 3 (cost_of_revenue for 2022/09/24).

4. **Get Multiple Rows and Columns**

```excel
=OBB.GET(A1:D3, {"2023/09/30", "2021/09/25"}, {"cost_of_revenue", "gross_profit"})
```

Returns a 2x2 array with cost_of_revenue and gross_profit for 2023 and 2021.

5. **Using Negative Indices**

```excel
=OBB.GET(A1:D3, -1, -2)
```

Returns the last row and second-to-last column (gross_profit for 2021/09/25).

### Advanced Usage

1. **Using Cell References for Selections**

```excel
=OBB.GET(A1:D3, E1:E2, F1:F2)
```

Where E1:E2 contains dates and F1:F2 contains column names.

2. **Combining with Other OBB Functions**

```excel
=OBB.GET(OBB.WIDGET("My backend", "income_statement", {"ticker","AAPL";"year","2023"}), "2023/09/30", "revenue")
```

Directly extracts revenue from the income statement widget result.

## Best Practices

1. **Date Formats**
   - Use `YYYY/MM/DD` format for date labels
   - Use Excel's DATE function: `DATE(2023,9,30)`
   - Ensure dates match exactly with the data

2. **Column Names**
   - Use exact column names as they appear in the data
   - Case-sensitive matching
   - Include underscores and spaces exactly as in the data

3. **Performance**
   - For large datasets, prefer using indices over labels
   - Use cell references for repeated selections
   - Avoid unnecessary array operations

## Troubleshooting

| Issue | Solution |
|-------|----------|
| #N/A error | Verify that the row/column labels exist in the data |
| #VALUE! error | Check that the array parameter is valid |
| Empty result | Confirm that the selection criteria match the data format |
| Date not found | Ensure date format matches exactly (YYYY/MM/DD) |

## Notes

- When using date labels, ensure consistent date formatting across your workbook
- Column names are case-sensitive
- The function preserves the original data types of the selected cells
- Empty or invalid selections will return appropriate error values
- For best performance with large datasets, consider using numeric indices instead of labels

import HeadTitle from '@site/src/components/General/HeadTitle.tsx';

<HeadTitle title="OBB.WIDGET | OpenBB Add-in for Excel Docs" />

This is the most important formula that is available, as it allows you to access any dataset available from the OpenBB workspace.

:::info

- Make sure your backend's CORS settings allow requests coming from [https://excel.openbb.co](https://excel.openbb.co).
- Requests via HTTP will be blocked by Excel. So if you are using the Add-in for Excel on Mac or Office on the web with Safari browser you need to run your backend via HTTPS.

:::

It has the following format:

```excel
=OBB.WIDGET(<BACKEND NAME>,<WIDGET ID> or <WIDGET NAME>, <PARAMETERS (OPTIONAL)>)
```

Where parameters, shows up as `{"param1","value1";"param2","value2"; ...}`.

Here are a few examples:

```excel
=OBB.WIDGET("DTCC Trades","swap_rate_levels_custom_obb",{"currency","USD";"swap_type","OIS";"period","1y"})
```

```excel
=OBB.WIDGET("DTCC Trades","Swap Trades",{"currency","USD";"date","2025-04-15";"cleared_only","true";"include_starting","false"})
```

```excel
=OBB.WIDGET("OpenBB Platform","economy_pce_fred_obb",{"category","personal_income";"provider","fred"})
```

```excel
=OBB.WIDGET("Custom Backend","Portugal CPI since 2000")
```

### Explicit parameters

The easiest way to pass optional parameters is to write them into cells and reference them in the function.

For example,

```excel
=OBB.WIDGET("DTCC Trades","swap_rate_levels_custom_obb",{"currency","USD";"swap_type","OIS";"period","1y"})
```

can be rewritten as:

```excel
=OBB.WIDGET("DTCC Trades","swap_rate_levels_custom_obb",A1:B3)
```

where:

- A1 contains "currency" and B1 "USD"
- A2 contains "swap_type" and B2 "OIS"
- A3 contains "period" and B3 "1y"

## Step by step

The steps are also described below:

1. Download the OpenBB Platform Installer which can be found [here](https://my.openbb.co/app/platform/downloads).

<img className="pro-border-gradient" width="1000" alt="Installer" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/f161c50a-93a4-45db-a504-9c9c45f59082" />


Select the right installer based on your OS and architecture. Then install it.

2. Once installation is complete, find the `OpenBB` folder that has been created in the installation directory selected. Double click on `OpenBB/openbb-api`.

<img className="pro-border-gradient" width="1000" alt="OpenBB API" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/baba4613-8253-431c-bce2-f9764533de41" />

3. A popup should be initiated, and you will be prompted to insert your personal access token (PAT), which can be retrieved from [here](https://my.openbb.co/app/platform/pat).

<img className="pro-border-gradient" width="1000" alt="PAT" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/43ac8f94-a0ce-4c38-9589-94d03322cfd7" />

Note: This assumes that the user has spent time setting up their API keys [here](https://my.openbb.co/app/platform/credentials).

<img className="pro-border-gradient" width="1000" alt="API Keys" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/f3e565c7-d343-421a-bfee-6be7acb79042" />


4. The OpenBB Platform API should now be up and running.

<img className="pro-border-gradient" width="1000" alt="OpenBB Platform API" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/5015a675-7953-4807-98d2-94cdc041fd64" />

5. Finally, you simply need to set up the custom backend on OpenBB Workspace.

:::note
If you are using Brave/Safari you will need an HTTPS connection - see how [here](https://docs.openbb.co/excel/faqs)
:::

<!-- TODO - We cant do this yet - issue with localhost in name - You can do so by clicking on this [link](http://pro.openbb.co/app/data-connectors?tab=my-data&modal=data-connectors&dcTab=backend&name=OpenBB%20Platform&url=http://localhost:6900). -->

Right click on a dashboard, then click "Add data".

<img className="pro-border-gradient" width="200" alt="Table Widget Example" src="https://openbb-cms.directus.app/assets/0c2c8866-54a8-4137-90b6-bf0db365ca6e.png" />

Then fill in the information as shown below:

<img className="pro-border-gradient" width="800" alt="Table Widget Example" src="https://openbb-cms.directus.app/assets/563aca68-1ec3-48c7-86d8-9129e0e5fd8c.png" />

Or you could also click this link to have it all filed in: https://pro.openbb.co/app?modal=connect-backend&name=OpenBB%20Platform&url=https://127.0.0.1:6900


6. Voila. You are now ready to access 300+ data widgets from OpenBB. For free.

These are some apps available out of the box:

<img className="pro-border-gradient" width="800" alt="Table Widget Example" src="https://openbb-cms.directus.app/assets/9d5f9dba-1603-489c-ad47-ae0f9b7bd0da.png" />

## Advanced - Access this data on mobile

This section will use `ngrok` as the proxy between our platform API endpoints running locally and the internet. You can do this in ngrok free plan.

1. Install ngrok by following [these](https://ngrok.com/docs/getting-started/) instructions.

2. Open a terminal and run `ngrok http 6900`. This assume that the open source platform API is running on http://localhost:6900.

If that runs correctly, you'll get an output similar to the following.

<img className="pro-border-gradient" width="1000" alt="ngrok" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/e938b28b-359b-41e7-b822-6fc400e36819" />

Note the **Forwarding** row. That will contain a public URL that has access to your endpoint.

3. Update your localhost endpoint with the public URL provided by ngrok.

<img className="pro-border-gradient" width="1000" alt="ngrok-2" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/1ceed65b-3601-4a7c-8fd5-ee79cdde3917" />

4. Add a request header as authentication.

Click on "Add Authentication" button, and add the following:

Key: ngrok-skip-browser-warning
Value: x
Location: Header

You have to include the request header `ngrok-skip-browser-warning` with any value in the request header, to bypass the Ngrok Browser Warning.

<img className="pro-border-gradient" width="1000" alt="ngrok-3" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/03968960-e09a-46d8-98b9-718b6ae1b0db" />

You are now ready to access this data on your phone, just ensure that you keep running the API endpoint and ngrok locally.

## Advanced - Filter widgets

If you run the steps above, you will have access to a dozen different data vendors and hundreds of different widgets. However, some of these may not work because you haven't set up the API key for the data vendor or you may not be interested to bring some of those widgets into your OpenBB Workspace.

This section will explore how you can filter the platform integration datasets that are made available on OpenBB.

1. Go to the [widgets filter page](https://my.openbb.co/app/platform/widgets) where you can set the data vendors you are interested and also select the widgets within. Once you are happy you can download the `widget_settings.json` configuration file by clicking on **Download**.

<img className="pro-border-gradient" width="1000" alt="widgets" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/c978c28d-e53a-4f83-9488-dcb524572b86" />

2. In the `OpenBB` folder that has been created when you installed the Platform. There must be a `Settings` folder within. This folder should be the destination of your widget setttings file (`widget_settings.json`), which will serve as the configuration file for your custom backend.

Now, similarly to the previous section, you should:
- Run `OpenBB/openbb-api`
- Set your PAT
- Refresh the connection inside the ["Manage Backends"](https://pro.openbb.co/app) button or follow instructions above to add again.

<!-- (http://pro.openbb.co/app/data-connectors?tab=my-data&modal=data-connectors&dcTab=backend&name=OpenBB%20Platform&url=http://localhost:6900) -->

> Take into consideration that, if you change the default configurations on the OpenBB Platform settings, the URL (http://127.0.0.1:6900) might differ.

<img className="pro-border-gradient" width="1000" alt="widgets-filter" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/692e8da3-57fb-4cff-b566-adf8d5539530" />

<HeadTitle title="Static Files | OpenBB Workspace Docs" />

OpenBB provides a powerful and intuitive way to import data through file uploads. This feature supports a wide range of file formats, allowing you to seamlessly integrate both structured and unstructured data into your analysis workflow.

## File Upload Process

The file upload interface offers a straightforward way to import your data. You can either select files individually or drag and drop them into the Add Data pop-up window. This flexibility supports importing multiple files simultaneously, regardless of their format.

<div style={{display: 'flex', justifyContent: 'center'}}>
  <img className="pro-border-gradient" width="600" alt="File upload interface showing the Add Data pop-up" src="https://openbb-web-assets.s3.amazonaws.com/docs/launch_oct_24/upload_file.png" />
</div>

### File Size Limitations

To ensure optimal performance and processing capabilities, OpenBB maintains a 25MB file size limit. While the system can technically handle larger files, this limit ensures that OpenBB Copilot can process your data effectively and provide meaningful insights.

### Metadata Management

Upon uploading your files, OpenBB automatically generates initial metadata for the widget, including the name and description. You have the flexibility to modify these fields to better suit your needs. Note that Enterprise customers can customize this automatic metadata generation feature.

</div>

### Accessing Uploaded Data

Once you've uploaded and configured your data, you can access the resulting widget through two primary methods:

1. The Search feature, which provides quick access to all your widgets
2. The Data Connector page, which offers a comprehensive view of your data sources

## Supported File Types

OpenBB supports two main categories of data files, each with specific use cases and visualization capabilities.

### Structured Data

Structured data files, including XLSX, JSON, and CSV formats, are ideal for quantitative analysis and data processing. Currently, XLSX files are limited to single-sheet imports. The system automatically converts these files into interactive widgets that display your data in a clear, organized format.

</div>

### Unstructured Data

OpenBB supports three types of unstructured data, each serving different analytical needs:

- Images (PNG and JPG): Perfect for visual analysis and documentation
- PDF Documents: Ideal for research papers, reports, and documentation
- Text Files (TXT and DOCX): Suitable for notes, research, and qualitative analysis

If you face specific issues while using the add-in and the solutions provided here don't resolve them, don't hesitate to reach out to us for further assistance. You can contact us through [support@openbb.finance](mailto:support@openbb.finance).

### #VALUE! Error

If you encounter a '#VALUE!' error when running an OBB function, first verify that you are using the correct syntax. Either [OBB.WIDGET](/excel/obb-widget) or [OBB.GET](/excel/obb-get).

- If you have just opened your workbook and see this error, try recalculating the cell - this is a known issue with Excel add-ins that sometimes requires a refresh.

### Add-in Not Available

If the OBB functions are not appearing after installation, try these troubleshooting steps:

- Verify that the OpenBB Add-in appears in your Excel ribbon
- If not visible, go to **Insert** > **Get Add-ins** > **My Add-ins**, hover over the OpenBB add-in, click '...', remove it, and reinstall
- If the issue persists, restart your computer or [clear the Office cache](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/office/dev/add-ins/testing/clear-cache)

### Permission Error

If you see the message "You don't have permission to use this add-in. Contact your system administrator to request access", try these solutions:

- Confirm that your account has the necessary permissions to use the add-in
- If permissions are correct, try restarting your computer or [clearing the Office cache](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/office/dev/add-ins/testing/clear-cache)

### Duplicate Ribbon Tab

If you notice duplicate 'OpenBB' tabs in the ribbon after editing a workbook in both browser and desktop versions, this is a known Excel issue. While there's no permanent fix, you can resolve it using these workarounds:

- **Windows users**: Go to File > Info > Inspect Workbook > Check 'Task Pane Add-ins' > Click 'OK'. This will remove the duplicate add-in reference created by Excel in the browser

- **Mac users**: 
  1. Rename your file from .xlsx to .zip
  2. Use WinZip for Mac to unzip the file (the default unzip tool won't work for this)
  3. Delete the webextension1.xml file from the webextensions folder
  4. Rename the file back to .xlsx

### Connection Issues

If you're unable to retrieve data through OBB.WIDGET from your backend, check these common issues:

- Ensure your backend server is running and accessible from your network
- For Mac or Safari users: Verify that your backend is using HTTPS with a valid SSL certificate
